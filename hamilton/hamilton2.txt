Se- se- seventeen...
BURR
1789.
How does the bastard orphan,
immigrant decorated war vet
unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has
to forfeit?
Have it all, lose it all,
you ready for more yet?
Treasury Secretary. Washington’s the
President,
ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent.
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him.
Pissed him off until we had a two-party
system.
You haven’t met him yet, you haven’t had
the chance,
‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador
to France
but someone’s gotta keep the American
promise.
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!
COMPANY
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home!
Thomas Jefferson’s coming home Lord he’s
been off in Paris for so long!
Aaa-ooo!
Aaa-ooo!
JEFFERSON
France is following us to revolution,
there is no more status quo.
But the sun comes up and the world still spins.
ENSEMBLE
Aaa-ooo!
JEFFERSON
I helped Lafayette draft a declaration,
then I said, ‘I gotta go.
I gotta be in Monticello.’ Now the work at
home begins…
ENSEMBLE
Aaa-ooo!
JEFFERSON
So what’d I miss?
What’d I miss?
Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give
you a kiss.
I’ve been in Paris meeting lots of different
ladies...
I guess I basic’lly missed the late eighties...
I traveled the wide, wide world and came
back to this…
ENSEMBLE
Aaa-ooo!
JEFFERSON
There’s a letter on my desk from the President.
Haven’t even put my bags down yet.
Sally be a lamb, darlin’, won’tcha open it?
It says the President’s assembling a cabinet
and that I am to be the Secretary of State,
great!
And that I’m already Senate-approved...
I just got home and now I’m headed up to
New York.
ENSEMBLE
Headin’ to New York!
Headin’ to New York!
JEFFERSON
Lookin’ at the rolling
fields
I can’t ENSEMBLE
believe that we
are free.
Believe that we are
free
Ready to face
whatever’s awaiting
me in N.Y.C. Me in N.Y.C.
JEFFERSON
But who’s waitin’ for me when I step in the
place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face.
JEFFERSON
He grabs my arm and
I respond, ENSEMBLE
“What’s goin’ on?” Aaa-ooo!
MADISON
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our
nation’s very soul.
Can you get us out of the mess we’re in?
ENSEMBLE
Aaa-ooo!
MADISON
Hamilton’s new financial plan is nothing less
than government control.
I’ve been fighting for the South alone.
Where have you been?
ENSEMBLE JEFFERSON
Aaa-ooo! Uh...France.
MADISON
We have to win.
JEFFERSON ENSEMBLE
What’d I miss? Wha? Wha? What’d
I miss?
What’d I miss? I’ve come home to
this?
Headfirst into a
political abyss!
Headfirst, into the
abyss!
I have my first
cabinet meeting
today, Chik-a-pow!
I guess I better think
of something to say,
I’m already on my
way, On my way
let’s get to the
bottom of this…
What did I miss?
Ahhh ah!
WASHINGTON
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home.
HAMILTON
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton.
WASHINGTON AND ENSEMBLE
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home.
COMPANY
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, you’ve been off in Paris for so long!
JEFFERSON
So what did I miss?
2. CABINET BATTLE #1
WASHINGTON
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been
anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re
here with us in New York City. Are you ready
for a cabinet meeting???
WASHINGTON
The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s
plan to assume state debt and establish a
national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have
the floor.
JEFFERSON
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t
settle for less.
These are wise words, enterprising men
quote ‘em.
Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em.
JEFFERSON/MADISON
Oww
JEFFERSON
But Hamilton forgets
his plan would have the government assume
state’s debts.
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
the very seat of government where Hamilton
sits.
HAMILTON
Not true!
JEFFERSON
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it.
If New York’s in debt—
why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are
paid, I’m afraid.
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in
the shade.
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground.
We create. You just wanna move our money
around.
This financial plan is an outrageous demand,
and it’s too many damn pages for any man to
understand.
Stand with me in the land of the free
and pray to God we never see Hamilton’s
candidacy.
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky.
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to
tax our whisky.
WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary
Hamilton, your response.
HAMILTON
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration.
Welcome to the present, we’re running a
real nation.
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow,
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in
Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic.
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and
competitive
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it
a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor,
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for
labor.
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”
Yeah, keep ranting,
we know who’s really doing the planting.
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment,
Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t
fight in it.
You think I’m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench
while you were off getting high with the
French.
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the
President,
reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison.
Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take
your medicine.
Damn, you’re in worse shape than the
national debt is in,
sittin’ there useless as two shits.
Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you
where my shoe fits.
WASHINGTON
Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk!
Hamilton, take a walk! We’ll reconvene after
a brief recess. Hamilton!
HAMILTON
Sir!
WASHINGTON
A word.
MADISON
You don’t have the votes.
JEFFERSON/MADISON
You don’t have the votes.
JEFFERSON
Aha-ha-ha ha!
JEFFERSON/MADISON
You’re gonna need congressional approval
and you don’t have the votes.
JEFFERSON
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me
wonder why I even bring the thunder.
MADISON
Why he even brings the thunder…
WASHINGTON
You wanna pull yourself together?
HAMILTON
I’m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a
feather.
WASHINGTON
Young man, I’m from Virginia, so watch your
mouth.
HAMILTON
So we let Congress get held hostage by the
South?
WASHINGTON
You need the votes.
HAMILTON
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan.
WASHINGTON
No, you need to convince more folks.
HAMILTON
James Madison won’t talk to me, that’s a
nonstarter.
WASHINGTON
Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s
harder.
HAMILTON
They’re being intransigent.
WASHINGTON
You have to find a compromise.
HAMILTON
But they don’t have a plan, they just hate
mine!
WASHINGTON
Convince them otherwise.
HAMILTON
What happens if I don’t get congressional
approval?
WASHINGTON
I imagine they’ll call for your removal.
HAMILTON
Sir—
WASHINGTON
Figure it out, Alexander. That’s an order from
your commander.
3. TAKE A BREAK

ELIZA AND PHILIP

HAMILTON
My dearest, Angelica,
“tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
another Scottish tragedy without my having
to name the play.
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is
my folly,
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive
pain,
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to
Dunsinane.
HAMILTON/ANGELICA
And there you are, an ocean away.
Do you have to live an
ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside,
then I get another letter,
I cannot put the notion away…
ELIZA
Take a break.
HAMILTON
I am on my way.
ELIZA
There’s a little surprise before supper
and it cannot wait.
HAMILTON
I’ll be there in just a minute, save my plate.
ELIZA
Alexander—
HAMILTON
Okay, okay—
ELIZA
Your son is nine years old today.
He has something he’d like to say.
He’s been practicing all day.
Philip, take it away—
PHILIP
Daddy, daddy, look—
My name is Philip.
I am a poet.
I wrote this poem just
to show it.
And I just turned nine.
You can write rhymes,
but you can’t write
mine. HAMILTON
What!
I practice French
and play
piano with my
mother.
Uh huh!
I have a sister but I
want a little brother.
Okay!
My daddy’s trying to
start America’s bank.
Un deux trois quatre

Bravo!
ELIZA
Take a break.
HAMILTON
Hey, our kid is pretty great.
ELIZA
Run away with us for the summer.
Let’s go upstate.
HAMILTON
Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate.
ELIZA
We can all go stay with my father.
There’s a lake I know…
HAMILTON
I know.
ELIZA
In a nearby park.
HAMILTON
I’d love to go.
ELIZA
You and I can go when the night gets dark…
HAMILTON
I will try to get away.
ANGELICA
My dearest Alexander,
You must get through to Jefferson.
Sit down with him and compromise,
don’t stop ‘til you agree
your fav’rite older sister,
Angelica, reminds you
there’s someone in your corner all the way
across the sea.
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase.
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking
days.
It says:
HAMILTON/ANGELICA
“My dearest Angelica”
ANGELICA
With a comma after “dearest.” you’ve written
HAMILTON AND ANGELICA
“My dearest, Angelica.”
ANGELICA
Anyway, all this to say
I’m coming home this summer
at my sister’s invitation,
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
if you make your way upstate.
I know you’re very busy,
I know your work’s important,
but I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t
wait.
HAMILTON AND ANGELICA
You won’t be an ocean away.
You will only be a moment away…
ELIZA
Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica’s
arriving today!
ELIZA
Angelica!
ANGELICA
Eliza!
HAMILTON
The Schuyler sisters!
ANGELICA
Alexander.
HAMILTON
Hi.
ANGELICA
It’s good to see your face.
ELIZA
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the
summer with his family.
HAMILTON
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn’t
have a real job anyway.
ANGELICA
…you’re not joining us? Wait.
HAMILTON
I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate.
ANGELICA
Alexander, I came all this way.
ELIZA
She came all this way–
ANGELICA
All this way–
ELIZA AND ANGELICA
Take a break.
HAMILTON
You know I have to get my plan through
Congress.
ELIZA AND ANGELICA
Run away with us for the summer.
Let’s go upstate.
HAMILTON
I lose my job if I don’t get my plan through
Congress.
ELIZA AND ANGELICA
We can all go stay with our father.

There’s a lake I know I know I’ll miss your

mark.

to be alive right now– Close your eyes and
dream–
We can go– when the night gets
dark.
When the night gets
dark.
Take a break.
Take a break.
HAMILTON
I have to get my plan through Congress.
I can’t stop until I get this plan through
Congress.
4. SAY NO TO THIS
BURR
There’s nothing like summer in the city.
Someone under stress meets someone
looking pretty.
There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it.
and Alexander’s by himself. I’ll let him tell it.
HAMILTON
I hadn’t slept in a week.
I was weak, I was awake.
You never seen a bastard orphan
more in need of a break.
Longing for Angelica.
Missing my wife.
That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into
my life, she said:
MARIA REYNOLDS
I know you are a man of honor,
I’m so sorry to bother you at home
but I don’t know where to go, and I came here
all alone...
HAMILTON
She said:
MARIA
My husband’s doin’ me wrong
beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me...
Suddenly he’s up and gone.
I don’t have the means to go on.
HAMILTON
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her
home, she said
MARIA
You’re too kind, sir.
HAMILTON
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away,
she lived a block away, she said:
MARIA
This one’s mine, sir.
HAMILTON
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,”
she turned red, she led me to her bed, let her
legs spread and said:
MARIA
Stay?
HAMILTON
Hey...
MARIA
Hey...
HAMILTON
That’s when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
say no to this.
I don’t know how to
say no to this.
HAMILTON
But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”
MARIA
Whoa…
HAMILTON
Nooo, show me how to
HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE
Say no to this.
HAMILTON
I don’t know how to
HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE
Say no to this.
HAMILTON
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go
ENSEMBLE
Go! Go! Go!
HAMILTON
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say...
ENSEMBLE
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
HAMILTON
I wish I could say that was the last time.
I said that last time. It became a pastime.
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
from a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it
said:
JAMES REYNOLDS
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good
health,
and in a prosperous enough position to put
wealth
in the pockets of people like me: down on
their luck.
You see, that was my wife who you decided to
HAMILTON
Fuuuu—
JAMES REYNOLDS
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold,
so time to pay the piper for the pants you
unbuckled.
And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife
if the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife.
HAMILTON
I hid the letter and I raced to her place,
screamed “How could you?!” in her face,
she said:
MARIA
No, sir!
HAMILTON
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
pathetic, she cried:
MARIA
Please don’t go, sir!
HAMILTON
So was your whole story a setup?
MARIA
I don’t know about any letter!
HAMILTON
Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!
MARIA
I didn’t know any better
HAMILTON
I am ruined...
MARIA HAMILTON
Please don’t leave me
with him helpless.
I am
helpless—how could I
do this?
Just give him what
he wants and you can
have me. I don’t want you
Whatever you want, I don’t want you
MARIA HAMILTON
If you pay, I don’t…
You can stay.
Lord, show
me how to ENSEMBLE
say no to this. Say no to this!
Tonight
I don’t know
how to
say no to this. Say no to this!
Cuz the
situation’s
helpless.
Helpless.
And her
body’s
screaming,
“Hell, yes”
Whoa!
No, show me
how to
say no to this. Say no to this!
How can I
How can you
say no to
this?
Say no to
this? Say no to this!
There is
nowhere I
can go.
When her
body’s on
mine Go! Go! Go!
I do not say...
No!
No!
HAMILTON ENSEMBLE
Yes. MARIA Say no to this!
Yes!
Yes.
No!
No!
Yes!
Say no to this!
Yes. Yes! No!
No!
Say no to this!
Yes. Yes!
No!
No!
Say no to this!
HAMILTON
Say no to this. MARIA
I don’t say no to this, Don’t say no to this.
there is nowhere I
can go. ENSEMBLE
Go go go…
JAMES REYNOLDS
So?
HAMILTON
Nobody needs to know.
5. THE ROOM WHERE
IT HAPPENS
BURR
Ah, Mister Secretary.
HAMILTON
Mister Burr, sir.
BURR
Didja hear the news about good old General
Mercer?
HAMILTON
No.
BURR
You know Clermont Street?
HAMILTON
Yeah.
BURR
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy
is secure.
HAMILTON
Sure.
BURR
And all he had to do was die.
HAMILTON
That’s a lot less work.
BURR
We oughta give it a try.
HAMILTON
Ha.
BURR
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan
through?
HAMILTON
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you.
BURR
Really?
HAMILTON
Talk less. Smile more.
BURR
Ha.
HAMILTON
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the
Congress floor.
BURR
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.
HAMILTON
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner.
MADISON
Hamilton!
HAMILTON
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go.
BURR
But—
HAMILTON
Decisions are happening over dinner.
BURR
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into
a room.
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Diametric’ly opposed, foes.
BURR
They emerge with a compromise, having
opened doors that were
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Previously closed,
ENSEMBLE
Bros.
BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented
financial power,
a system he can shape however he wants.
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s
capital.
And here’s the pièce de résistance:
BURR
No one else was in
the room where it

But no one else is in

BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep
one day
in distress ‘n disarray.
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Alexander said—
HAMILTON
I’ve nowhere else to turn!
JEFFERSON
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray.
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
I approached Madison and said–
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he
has to say.”
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—

But no one else is in

BURR AND COMPANY
Meanwhile—
BURR
Madison is grappling with the fact that not
ev’ry issue can be settled by committee.
COMPANY
Meanwhile—
BURR
Congress is fighting over where to put the
capital—
Company screams in chaos.
BURR
It isn’t pretty.
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner
and invite,
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:
MADISON
Maybe we can solve one problem with another
and win a victory for the Southerners, in
other words—
JEFFERSON
Oh-ho!
MADISON
A quid pro quo.
JEFFERSON
I suppose.
MADISON
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to
home?
JEFFERSON
Actually, I would.
MADISON
Well, I propose the Potomac.
JEFFERSON
And you’ll provide him his votes?
MADISON
Well, we’ll see how it goes.
JEFFERSON
Let’s go.
BURR
No!
COMPANY

No one else was in

BURR
My God!
BURR AND COMPANY
In God we trust.
But we’ll never really know what got
discussed.
Click-boom then it happened.
BURR
And no one else was in the room where it
happened.
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
What did they say to you to get you to sell
New York City down the river?
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
where you put the U.S. Capital?
HAMILTON
Cuz we’ll have the banks,
we’re in the same spot.
BURR
You got more than you gave.
HAMILTON
And I wanted what I got.
When you got skin in the game, you stay in
the game.
But you don’t get a win unless you play in
the game.
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it.
You get nothing if you...

Look! Grampa’s in the paper! ‘War Hero Philip
Schuyler loses Senate seat to young upstart
Aaron Burr!’
Grampa just lost his seat in the Senate.
ELIZA
Sometimes that’s how it goes.
PHILIP
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute.

I’m sure he already knows.

HAMILTON
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?
BURR
Since being one put me on the up and up
again.
HAMILTON
No one knows who you are or what you do.
BURR
They don’t need to know me. They don’t
like you.
HAMILTON
Excuse me?
BURR
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great.
You’ll always be adored by the things you
create.
But upstate,
HAMILTON
Wait.
BURR
People think you’re crooked!
And Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs, so I
took it.
HAMILTON
I’ve always considered you a friend.
BURR
I don’t see why that has to end!
HAMILTON
You changed parties to run against my
father-in-law.
BURR
I changed parties to seize the opportunity
I saw.
I swear, your pride will be the death of us all!
Beware: it goeth before the fall…
7. CABINET BATTLE #2
WASHINGTON
The issue on the table: France is on the verge
of war with England. Do we provide aid and
troops to our French allies or do we stay out
of it? Remember, my decision on this matter
is not subject to congressional approval.
The only person you have to convince is me.
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir.
JEFFERSON
When we were on death’s door, when we
were needy,
we made a promise, we signed a treaty.
We needed money and guns and half a chance.
Who provided those funds?
MADISON
France. 
JEFFERSON
In return, they didn’t ask for land,
only a promise that we’d lend a hand
and stand with them if they fought against
oppressors,
and revolution is messy but now is the time
to stand.
Stand with our brothers as they fight against
tyranny.
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
would rather not have this debate.
I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of
State.
He knows nothing of loyalty,
smells like new money, dresses like fake
royalty,
desperate to rise above his station,
everything he does betrays the ideals of our
nation.
ENSEMBLE
Ooh!!
JEFFERSON
Hey, and if ya don’t know, now ya know, Mr.
President.
WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary
Hamilton, your response.
HAMILTON
You must be out of your Goddamn mind if
you think
the President is gonna bring the nation to
the brink
of meddling in the middle of a military mess,
a game of chess, where France is Queen and
Kingless.
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is
now in a basket.
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
“Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’
head?”
“Uh… do whatever you want, I’m super dead .”
WASHINGTON
Enough. Hamilton is right.
JEFFERSON
Mr. President—
WASHINGTON
We’re too fragile to start another fight.
JEFFERSON
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?
WASHINGTON
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna
lead ‘em.
JEFFERSON
The people are leading—
WASHINGTON
The people are rioting.
There’s a difference. Frankly, it’s a little
disquieting you would let your ideals blind
you to reality.
Hamilton.
HAMILTON
Sir.
WASHINGTON
Draft a statement of neutrality.
JEFFERSON
Did you forget Lafayette?
HAMILTON
What?
JEFFERSON
Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power,
yet in their hour of need, you forget.
HAMILTON
Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine.
And before he was your friend, he was mine.
If we try to fight in every revolution in the
world, we never stop.
Where do we draw the line?
JEFFERSON
So quick-witted.
HAMILTON
Alas, I admit it.
JEFFERSON
I bet you were quite a lawyer.
HAMILTON
My defendants got acquitted.
JEFFERSON
Huh. Well, someone oughta remind you.
HAMILTON
What?
JEFFERSON
You’re nothing without Washington behind
you.
WASHINGTON
Hamilton!
JEFFERSON
Daddy’s calling.
8. WASHINGTON ON
YOUR SIDE
BURR
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side.
JEFFERSON
Ev’ry action has its equal, opposite reactions.
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab’net’s fractured
into factions.
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re
breaking down like fractions.
We smack each other in the press, and we
don’t print retractions.
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of
passion.
The way he primps and preens and dresses
like the pits of fashion.
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration
to ration
as Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips
to cash in.
This prick is askin’ for someone to bring him
to task.
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous
mass so we can at last unmask him.
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the
gun and cock it.
While we were all watching, he got
Washington in his pocket.
JEFFERSON AND BURR
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side.
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side.
Look back at the Bill of Rights.
MADISON
Which I wrote.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
The ink hasn’t dried.
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side.
MADISON
So he’s doubled the size of the government.
Wasn’t the trouble with much our previous
government size?
BURR
Look in his eyes!
JEFFERSON
See how he lies.
MADISON
Follow the scent of his enterprise.
JEFFERSON
Centralizing national credit
and making American credit competitive.
MADISON
If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it.
JEFFERSON
I have to resign.
MADISON
Somebody has to stand up for the South!
BURR
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
JEFFERSON
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse,
MADISON AND JEFFERSON
You can’t put it out from inside the house.
JEFFERSON
I’m in the cabinet. I am complicit in
watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it.
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen
to disciplined dissidents, this is the
difference:
This kid is out!
MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON
Oh!
This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose.
Oh!
This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes.
Oh!
Let’s show these Federalists who they’re up
against!
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON
Southern motherfuckin’-
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Democratic-Republicans!
JEFF/MAD/BURR/ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Let’s follow the money and see where it goes.
ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Because every second the Treasury grows.
ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
If we follow the money and see where it leads,
get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamilton’s misdeeds.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
It must be nice. It must be nice.
MADISON
Follow the money and see where it goes.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
It must be nice. It must be nice.
JEFFERSON
The emperor has no clothes.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
We won’t be invisible. We won’t be denied.
Still,
it must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side.
9. ONE LAST TIME
HAMILTON
Mr. President, you asked to see me?
WASHINGTON
I know you’re busy.
HAMILTON
What do you need, sir? Sir?
WASHINGTON
I wanna give you a word of warning.
HAMILTON
Sir, I don’t know what you heard,
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it.
WASHINGTON
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning.
HAMILTON
You’re kidding.
WASHINGTON
I need a favor.
HAMILTON
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for
his behavior.
WASHINGTON
Shh. Talk less.
HAMILTON
I’ll use the press,
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what
I can do to him—
WASHINGTON
I need you to draft an address.
HAMILTON
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your
mind—
WASHINGTON
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for
President.
HAMILTON
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir.
WASHINGTON
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for
President.
HAMILTON
I’m sorry, what?
WASHINGTON
One last time.
Relax, have a drink with me
one last time.
Let’s take a break tonight
and then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye,
to say goodbye.
You and I.
HAMILTON
No, sir, why?
WASHINGTON
I wanna talk about neutrality.
HAMILTON
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of
war, is this the best time—
WASHINGTON
I want to warn against partisan fighting.
HAMILTON
But—
WASHINGTON
Pick up a pen, start writing.
I wanna talk about what I have learned.
The hard-won wisdom I have earned.
HAMILTON
As far as the people are concerned,
you have to serve, you could continue to
serve—
WASHINGTON
No! One last time
the people will hear from me
one last time
and if we get this right
we’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
goodbye.
You and I—
HAMILTON
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak.
WASHINGTON
No, they will see we’re strong.
HAMILTON
Your position is so unique.
WASHINGTON
So I’ll use it to move them along.
HAMILTON
Why do you have to say goodbye?
WASHINGTON
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on.
It outlives me when I’m gone.
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and
fig tree
and no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made.
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree.
A moment alone in the shade,
at home in this nation we’ve made.
One last time.
HAMILTON
One last time.
HAMILTON
Though, in reviewing the incidents of
my administration, I am unconscious of
intentional error, I am nevertheless too
sensible of my defects not to think it probable
that I may have committed many errors.
I shall also carry with me
HAMILTON WASHINGTON

10. I KNOW HIM
KING GEORGE
They say
George Washington’s yielding his power and
stepping away.
‘Zat true?
I wasn’t aware that was something a person
could do.
I’m perplexed.
Are they gonna keep on replacing whoever’s
in charge?
If so, who’s next?
There’s nobody else in their country who
looms quite as large . . .
A sentinel whispers in King George’s ear.
John Adams?!
I know him.
That can’t be.
That’s that little guy who spoke to me
all those years ago.
What was it, eighty-five?
That poor man, they’re gonna eat him alive!
Oceans rise.
Empires fall.
Next to Washington, they all look small.
All alone,
watch them run.
They will tear each other into pieces,
Jesus Christ, this will be fun!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da da dat dat da ya daaaaa!
“President John Adams”
Good Luck.
11. THE ADAMS
ADMINISTRATION
BURR
How does Hamilton, the short-tempered,
protean creator of the Coast Guard,
Founder of the New York Post,
ardently abuse his cab’net post,
destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to
BURR/COMPANY
The Adams administration!
BURR
Jefferson’s the runner-up, which makes him
the Vice President.
JEFFERSON
Washington can’t help you now, no more
mister nice President.
BURR
Adams fires Hamilton.
Privately calls him “creole bastard” in his
taunts.
JEFFERSON
Say what?!
BURR
Hamilton publishes his response.
HAMILTON
Sit down, John, you fat motherfBURR
Hamilton is out of control.
MADISON
This is great! He’s out of power. He holds no
office. And he just destroyed President John
Adams, the only other significant member
of his party.
JEFFERSON
Hamilton’s a host unto himself. As long as
he can hold a pen, he’s a threat. Let’s let him
know what we know.
12. WE KNOW
HAMILTON
Mr. Vice President.
Mr. Madison.
Senator Burr.
What is this?
JEFFERSON
We have the check stubs. From separate
accounts...
MADISON
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different
amounts...
BURR
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in
seventeen ninety-one.
HAMILTON
Is that what you have? Are you done?
MADISON
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your
position—
JEFFERSON
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this
situation—
MADISON
To seek financial gain, to stray from your
sacred mission—
JEFFERSON
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged
in speculation—
BURR
An immigrant embezzling our government
funds—
JEFFERSON/MADISON
I can almost see the headline, your career
is done.
BURR
I hope you saved some money for your
daughter and sons .
BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON
Ya best g’wan run back where ya come from.
HAMILTON
Ha! You don’t even know what you’re asking
me to confess.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Confess.
HAMILTON
You got nothing. I don’t have to tell you
anything at all.
Unless.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Unless?
HAMILTON
If I can prove that I never broke the law,
do you promise not to tell another soul what
you saw?
BURR
No one else was in the room where it
happened.
HAMILTON
Is that a yes?
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Um, yes.
BURR
“Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good
health
and in a prosperous enough position to put
wealth
in the pockets of people like me: down on
their luck.
You see, it was my wife who you decided to –”
JEFFERSON
Whaaaat –
HAMILTON
She courted me.
Escorted me to bed and when she had me
in a corner
that’s when Reynolds extorted me
for a sordid fee.
I paid him quarterly.
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
but my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check
in my checkered
History. Check it again against your list n’ see
consistency.
I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine,
you sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine.
Yes, I have reasons for shame
but I have not committed treason and sullied
my good name.
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke
legal action.
Are my answers to your satisfaction?
JEFFERSON
My God.
MADISON
Gentlemen, let’s go.
HAMILTON
So?
JEFFERSON AND MADISON
The people won’t know what we know.
HAMILTON
Burr!
How do I know you won’t use this against me
the next time we go toe to toe?
BURR
Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both
know what we know.
13. HURRICANE
HAMILTON
In the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet
for just a moment,
a yellow sky.
When I was seventeen a hurricane
destroyed my town.
I didn’t drown.
I couldn’t seem to die.
I wrote my way out,
wrote everything down far as I could see.
I wrote my way out.
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me.
They passed a plate around.
Total strangers
moved to kindness by my story.
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
ship that was New York bound…
I wrote my way out of hell.
I wrote my way to revolution.
I was louder than the crack in the bell.
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell.
I wrote about The Constitution and defended
it well.
And in the face of ignorance and resistance,
I wrote financial systems into existence.
And when my prayers to God were met with
indifference,
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance.
In the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet
for just a moment,
a yellow sky.
I was twelve when my mother died.
She was holding me.
We were sick and she was holding me.
I couldn’t seem to die.
BURR
Wait for it,
wait for it, HAMILTON
wait for it... I’ll write my
way out...
BURR AND

ELIZA
I saved every letter you wrote me.
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine.
You said you were mine.
I thought you were mine.
Do you know what Angelica said
when we saw your first letter arrive?
She said,
“Be careful with that one, love.
He will do what it takes to survive.”
You and your words flooded my senses.
Your sentences left me defenseless.
You built me palaces out of paragraphs,
you built cathedrals.
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me.
I’m searching and scanning for answers
in every line,
for some kind of sign,
and when you were mine
the world seemed to
Burn.
Burn.
You published the letters she wrote you.
You told the whole world how you brought
this girl into our bed.
In clearing your name, you have ruined our
lives.
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said,
“You have married an Icarus.
He has flown too close to the sun.”
You and your words, obsessed with your
legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless,
and you are paranoid in every paragraph
how they perceive you,
You, you, you...
I’m erasing myself from the narrative.
Let future historians wonder
how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart.
You have torn it all apart.
I am watching it
burn.
Watching it burn.
The world has no right to my heart.
The world has no place in our bed.
They don’t get to know what I said.
I’m burning the memories,
Burning the letters that might have redeemed
you.
You forfeit all rights to my heart.
You forfeit the place in our bed.
You sleep in your office instead,
with only the memories
of when you were mine.
I hope that you burn.
16. BLOW US ALL AWAY
PHILIP
Meet the latest graduate of King’s College!
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but, dag, I amaze
and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and
brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brain’s not where the
resemblance stops!
I’m only nineteen but my mind is older,
gotta be my own man, like my father, but
bolder.

I used to hear him say
that someday
 I would—

Blow us all away.

about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was
not about to—
HAMILTON
Slow down.
PHILIP
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very
first duel.
They don’t exactly cover this subject in
boarding school.
HAMILTON
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a
peace?
PHILIP
He refused to apologize, we had to let the
peace talks cease.
HAMILTON
Where is this happening?
PHILIP
Across the river, in Jersey.
HAMILTON/PHILIP
Everything is legal in New Jersey...
HAMILTON
Alright. So this is what you’re gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front
of you.
When the time comes, fire your weapon in
the air.
This will put an end to the whole affair.
PHILIP
But what if he decides to shoot? Then I’m
a goner.
HAMILTON
No. He’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of
honor.
To take someone’s life, that is something you
can’t shake.
Philip, your mother can’t take another
heartbreak.
PHILIP

HAMILTON
Promise me. You don’t want this
young man’s blood on your conscience.

I walk alone to the store,
and it’s quiet uptown.
I never liked the quiet before.
I take the children to church on Sunday,
a sign of the cross at the door,
and I pray.
That never used to happen before.
ANGELICA AND WOMEN
If you see him in the street, walking by
himself, talking to himself,
have pity.
HAMILTON
Philip, you would like it uptown.
It’s quiet uptown.
ANGELICA AND WOMEN
He is working through the unimaginable.
ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
His hair has gone grey. He passes every day.
They say he walks the length of the city.
HAMILTON
You knock me out, I fall apart.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND
ELIZA)
Can you imagine?
HAMILTON
Look at where we are.
Look at where we started.
I know I don’t deserve you, Eliza.
But hear me out. That would be enough.
If I could spare his life,
If I could trade his life for mine,
he’d be standing here right now
and you would smile, and that would be
enough.
I don’t pretend to know
the challenges we’re facing.
I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost
and you need time.
But I’m not afraid,
I know who I married.
Just let me stay here by your side,
That would be enough.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND
ELIZA)
If you see him in the street, walking by her
side, talking by her side, have pity.
HAMILTON
Eliza, do you like it uptown? It’s quiet uptown.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND
ELIZA)
He is trying to do the unimaginable.
See them walking in the park, long after dark,
taking in the sights of the city.
HAMILTON
Look around, look around, Eliza.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND
ELIZA)
They are trying to do the unimaginable.
ANGELICA
There are moments that the words don’t reach.
There is a grace too powerful to name.
We push away what we can never understand,
we push away the unimaginable.
They are standing in the garden,
Alexander by Eliza’s side.
She takes his hand.
ELIZA
It’s quiet uptown.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND
ELIZA)
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her
side, talking by her side, have pity.
They are going through the unimaginable.
19. THE ELECTION
OF 1800
FULL COMPANY
The election of 1800.
JEFFERSON
Can we get back to politics?
MADISON
Please?
JEFFERSON
Yo. Ev’ry action has an equal, opposite
reaction.
John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but
he’s in traction.
Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in
action.
So now I’m facing—
JEFFERSON AND MADISON
Aaron Burr!
JEFFERSON
With his own faction.
MADISON
He’s very attractive in the North. New Yorkers
like his chances.
JEFFERSON
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular
stances.
MADISON
Ask him a question: it glances off, he
obfuscates, he dances.
JEFFERSON
And they say I’m a Francophile: at least they
know I know where France is!
MADISON
Thomas that’s the problem, see, they see Burr
as a less extreme you.
JEFFERSON
Ha!
MADISON
You need to change course, a key
endorsement might redeem you.
JEFFERSON
Who did you have in mind?
MADISON
Don’t laugh.
JEFFERSON
Who is it?
MADISON
You used to work on the same staff.
JEFFERSON
Whaaaat.
MADISON
It might be nice, it might be nice
to get Hamilton on your side.
JEFFERSON AND MADISON
It might be nice, it might be nice

JEFFERSON
Uh-huh.
BURR
I look forward to our partnership.
JEFFERSON
Our partnership?
BURR
As your vice-President.
JEFFERSON
Ha. Yeah, right.
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns
against me, talkin’ bout, “I look forward to
our partnership.”
MADISON
It’s crazy that the guy who comes in second
becomes vice President.
JEFFERSON
Yeah, you know what? We can change that.
You know why?
MADISON
Why?
JEFFERSON
‘cuz I’m the President. Hey, Burr, when you see
Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement.
20. YOUR OBEDIENT
SERVANT
BURR
How does Hamilton,
an arrogant,
immigrant, orphan,
bastard, whoreson,
somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy,
a man he’s despised since the beginning,
just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens —
BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happens.
The room where it happens.
BURR
You’ve kept me from—
 BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happens.
BURR
For the last time.
Dear Alexander:
I am slow to anger,
but I toe the line
as I reckon with the effects
of your life on mine.
I look back on where I failed,
and in every place I checked,
the only common thread has been your
disrespect.
Now you call me “amoral,”
a “dangerous disgrace,”
if you’ve got something to say,
name a time and place,
face to face.
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant,
A dot Burr.
HAMILTON
Mr. Vice President,
I am not the reason no one trusts you.
No one knows what you believe.
I will not equivocate on my opinion,
I have always worn it on my sleeve.
Even if I said what you think I said,
you would need to cite a more specific
grievance.
Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of
disagreements.
BURR
Sweet Jesus.
HAMILTON
Hey, I have not been shy.
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin’ to do my best for our republic.
I don’t wanna fight,
But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right.
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant,
A dot Ham.
BURR
Careful how you proceed, good man.
Intemperate indeed, good man.
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
prepare to bleed, good man.
HAMILTON
Burr, your grievance is legitimate.
I stand by what I said, every bit of it.
You stand only for yourself.
It’s what you do.
I can’t apologize because it’s true.
BURR
Then stand, Alexander.
Weehawken. Dawn.
Guns. Drawn.
HAMILTON
You’re on.
BURR AND HAMILTON
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant,
HAMILTON
A dot Ham.
BURR
A dot Burr.
21. BEST OF WIVES AND
BEST OF WOMEN
ELIZA
Alexander, come back to sleep.
HAMILTON
I have an early meeting out of town.
ELIZA
It’s still dark outside.
HAMILTON
I know. I just need to write something down.
ELIZA
Why do you write like you’re running out
of time?
HAMILTON
Shhh.
ELIZA
Come back to bed. That would be enough.
HAMILTON
I’ll be back before you know I’m gone.
ELIZA
Come back to sleep.
HAMILTON
This meeting’s at dawn.
ELIZA
Well, I’m going back to sleep.
HAMILTON
Hey. Best of wives and best of women.
22. THE WORLD WAS
WIDE ENOUGH
MALE COMPANY
One two three four
FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON
AND BURR)
Five six seven eight nine—
BURR
There are ten things you need to know.
COMPANY
Number one!
BURR
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn.
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on
as my—
BURR AND COMPANY
Number two!
BURR
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew.
COMPANY
Number three!
BURR
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain.
I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning
in his brain.
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!
COMPANY
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!
BURR
Hamilton drew first position.
Looking,to the world, like a man on a mission.
This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability.
The doctor turned around so he could have
deniability.
COMPANY
Five!
BURR
Now I didn’t know
this at the time
But we were—
BURR AND PHILIP HAMILTON
Near the same spot
your son died, is
that why—
Near the same spot
my son died, is that
why—
COMPANY
Six!
BURR
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with
the trigger.
COMPANY
Seven!
BURR
Confession time? Here’s what I got:
My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible
shot.
COMPANY
Number eight!
BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN
Your last chance to negotiate.
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the
record straight.
BURR
They won’t teach you this in your classes,
but look it up, Hamilton was wearing his
glasses.
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It’s him or me, the world will never be the
same.
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my
daughter.
COMPANY
Number nine!
BURR
Look him in the eye, aim no higher.
Summon all the courage you require.
Then count:
COMPANY
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!—
HAMILTON
I imagine death so much it feels more like
a memory.
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral
feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or
let it be?
There is no beat, no melody.
Burr, my first friend, my enemy,
maybe the last face I ever see,
If I throw away my shot, is this how you
remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?
Legacy. What is a legacy?
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never
get to see.
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song
someone will sing for me.
America, you great unfinished symphony, you
sent for me.
You let me make a difference.
A place where even orphan immigrants
can leave their fingerprints and rise up.
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my
time’s up.
Wise up. Eyes up.
I catch a glimpse of the other side.
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the
other side.
My son is on the other side.
He’s with my mother on the other side.
Washington is watching from the other side.
Teach me how to say goodbye.
Rise up, rise up, rise up,
Eliza,
My love, take your time.
I’ll see you on the other side.
Raise a glass to freedom…
 BURR AND COMPANY
He aims his pistol at the sky—
BURR
Wait!
BURR
I strike him right between his ribs.
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away.
They row him back across the Hudson.
I get a drink.
COMPANY
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
BURR
I hear wailing in the streets.
COMPANY
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
BURR
Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.”
COMPANY
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
BURR
They say
BURR AND ANGELICA
Angelica and Eliza—
BURR
Were both at his side when he died.
Death doesn’t discriminate
between the sinners and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes.
History obliterates.
In every picture it paints,
it paints me with all my mistakes.
When Alexander aimed
at the sky,
he may have been the first one to die,
but I’m the one who paid for it.
I survived, but I paid for it.
Now I’m the villain in your history.
I was too young and blind to see...
I should’ve known.
I should’ve known
the world was wide enough for both Hamilton
and me.
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton
and me.
