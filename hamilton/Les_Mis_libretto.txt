["Work Song"]

[PRISONERS]
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh

Look down, look down
Don't look 'em in the eye
Look down, look down
You're here until you die

[PRISONER #1]
The sun is strong
It's hot as Hell below

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
There's twenty years to go

[PRISONER #2]
I've done no wrong
Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
Sweet Jesus doesn't care

[PRISONER #3]
I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
They've all forgotten you

[PRISONER #4]
When I get free you won't see me
Here for dust

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
Don't look 'em in the eye

[PRISONER #5]
How long, oh Lord
Before you let me die?

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave

[JAVERT]
Now bring me Prisoner 24601
Your time is up
And your parole's begun
You know what that means

[VALJEAN]
Yes, it means I'm free

[JAVERT]
No!
It means you get your yellow ticket-of-leave
You are a thief

[VALJEAN]
I stole a loaf of bread

[JAVERT]
You robbed a house!

[VALJEAN]
I broke a window pane
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving

[JAVERT]
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law

[VALJEAN]
I know the meaning of those nineteen years
A slave of the law

[JAVERT]
Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
Yes, 24601

[VALJEAN]
My name is Jean Valjean!

[JAVERT]
And I'm Javert
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me, 24601

[PRISONERS]
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave
Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh

["On Parole"]

[VALJEAN]
Freedom is mine
The earth is still
I feel the wind
I breathe again
And the skies clear
The world is waking

Drink from the pool
How clean the taste
Never forget the years, the waste
Nor forgive them
For what they've done
They are the guilty, everyone
The day begins
And now let's see
What this new world
Will do for me

[FARMER]
You'll have to go
I'll pay you off for the day
Collect your bits and pieces there
And be on your way

[VALJEAN]
You have given me half
What the other men get
This handful of tin
Wouldn't buy my sweat

[LABORER]
You broke the law
It's there for people to see
Why should you get the same
As honest men like me

[VALJEAN]
Now every door is closed to me
Another jail, another key, another chain
For when I come to any town
They check my papers
And they find the mark of Cain
In their eyes, I see their fear
"We do not want you here"

[INNKEEPER'S WIFE]
My rooms are full
And I've no supper to spare
I'd like to help a stranger
All we want is to be fair

[VALJEAN]
I will pay in advance
I can sleep in a barn
You see how dark it is
I'm not some kind of dog

[INNKEEPER]
You leave my house!
Or feel the weight of my rod
We're law-abiding people here
Thanks be to God

[VALJEAN]
And now I know how freedom feels
The jailer always at your heels
It is the law
This piece of paper in my hand
That makes me cursed throughout the land
It is the law
Like a cur
I walk the street
The dirt beneath their feet

["Valjean Arrested/Valjean Forgiven"]

[BISHOP]
Come in, Sir, for you are weary
And the night is cold out there
Though our lives are very humble
What we have, we have to share

There is wine here to revive you
There is bread to make you strong
There's a bed to rest 'til morning
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong

[VALJEAN]
He let me eat my fill, I had the lion's share
This silver in my hand, costs twice what I had earned
In all those nineteen years, a lifetime of despair
And yet he trusted me

The old fool trusted me, he'd done his bit of good
I played the grateful serf and thanked him like I should
But when the house was still, I got up in the night
Took the silver, took my flight!

[Valjean runs away, but is caught by the constables and brought back to the bishop.]

[CONSTABLE #1]
Tell his reverence your story

[CONSTABLE #2]
Let us see if he's impressed

[CONSTABLE #1]
You were lodging here last night

[CONSTABLE #2]
You were the honest Bishop's guest
And then out of Christian goodness
When he learned about your plight

[CONSTABLE #1]
You maintain he made a present of this silver

[BISHOP]
That is right

But my friend, you left so early
Surely something slipped your mind
You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind?

[The bishop gives Valjean two candlesticks.]

So, M'sieur, you may release him
For this man has spoken true
I commend you for your duty
And God's blessing go with you

[The constables leave.]

[BISHOP (to Valjean)]
But remember this, my brother
See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man

By the witness of the martyrs
By the Passion and the Blood
God has raised you out of darkness
I have bought your soul for God!

[VALJEAN]
What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
Become a thief in the night, become a dog on the run
Have I fallen so far and is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate?
The cries in the dark that nobody hears
Here where I stand at the turning of the years

If there's another way to go
I missed it twenty long years ago
My life was a war that could never be won
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread

Yet why did I allow this man
To touch my soul and teach me love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust, he called me brother

My life he claims for God above
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world
This world that always hated me

Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!
This is all I have lived for!
This is all I have known!

One word from him and I'd be back
Beneath the lash, upon the rack
Instead he offers me my freedom
I feel my shame inside me like a knife

He told me that I had a soul
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my life?
Is there another way to go?

I am reaching, but I fall
And the night is closing in
And I stare into the void
To the whirlpool of my sin

I'll escape now from the world
From the world of Jean Valjean
Jean Valjean is nothing now
Another story must begin!

[He tears up his yellow ticket-of-leave.]

[WORKERS]
At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day, standing about, what is it for?
One day less to be living

At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying

[WOMEN & MEN (overlapping)]
At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned
And there's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day

[FOREMAN]
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread

[MALE WORKER]
There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job

[WOMAN #1]
And in a bed

[BOTH]
And we're counting our blessings!

[WOMAN #2]
Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?

[WOMAN #3]
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way

[#1]
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!

[WOMAN #4]
And the boss, he never knows
That the foreman is always in heat

[#3]
If Fantine doesn't look out, watch how she goes
She’ll be out on the street

[WOMEN & MEN (overlapping)]
At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
Keep on grafting till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs on the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day!

[#1]
Now what have we here, little innocent sister?
Come on Fantine, let's have all the news!
"Dear Fantine, you must send us more money
Cosette needs a doctor
There's no time to lose"

[FANTINE]
Give that letter to me, it is none of your business
With a husband at home and a bit on the side!
Is there anyone here who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

[VALJEAN]
Will someone tear these two apart
What is this fighting all about
This is a factory, not a circus
Now come on ladies, settle down
I run a business of repute
I am the Mayor of this town

I'll look to you to sort this out
And be as patient as you can

[FOREMAN]
Now someone say how this began

[#1]
At the end of the day she's the one who began it
There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town
There's a man she has to pay
You can guess how she picks up the extra
You can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around
And the boss wouldn't like it

[FANTINE]
Yes, it's true there's a child and the child is my daughter
And her father abandoned us leaving us flat
Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?

[WOMEN (overlapping)]
At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble
And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one
While we're earning our daily bread
She's the one with her hands in the butter
You must send the slut away
Or we're all gonna end in the gutter
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day

[FOREMAN]
I might have known the bitch could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret
Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean
You'd be the cause I had no doubt
Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night

[#1]
She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men

[WOMEN]
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again

[#1]
You must sack her today

[WOMEN]
Sack the girl today

[FOREMAN]
Right, my girl. On your way!

[FANTINE]
There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time...
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed

[SAILOR #1]
I smell women, smell 'em in the air
Think I'll drop my anchor in that harbor over there

[SAILOR #2]
Lovely ladies, smell 'em through the smoke
Seven days at sea can make you hungry for a poke

[SAILOR #3]
Even stokers need a little stoke!

[WOMEN]
Lovely ladies, waiting for a bite
Waiting for the customers who only come at night
Lovely ladies, waiting for the call
Standing up or lying down or any way at all
Bargain prices up against the wall

[OLD WOMAN (approaching Fantine)]
Come here, my dear, let's see this trinket you wear
This bagatelle

[FANTINE]
Madame, I'll sell it to you

[OLD WOMAN]
I'll give you four

[FANTINE]
That wouldn't pay for the chain

[OLD WOMAN]
I'll give you five. You're far too eager to sell
It's up to you...

[FANTINE]
It's all I have

[OLD WOMAN]
That's not my fault

[FANTINE]
Please make it ten

[OLD WOMAN]
No more than five
My dear, we all must stay alive

[WOMEN]
Lovely ladies, waiting in the dark
Ready for a thick one or a quick one in the park

[WHORE #1]
Long time, short time, any time, my dear
Cost a little extra if you want to take all year!

[WOMEN]
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!

[CRONE (approaching Fantine)]
What pretty hair, what pretty locks you got there
What luck you got, it's worth a centime my dear
I'll take the lot

[FANTINE]
Don't touch me! Leave me alone

[CRONE]
Let's make a price, I'll give you all of ten francs
Just think of that

[FANTINE]
It pays a debt

[CRONE]
Just think of that

[FANTINE]
What can I do? It pays a debt
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette
 
[SAILORS] [WHORES] 

Lovely lady Lovely ladies 

Fastest on the street Lovely little girls 

Wasn't there three minutes Lovely ladies 

She was back up on her feet Lovely little ladies 

Lovely lady Lovely girlies 

What you waiting for Lovely little girls 

Doesn't take a lot of savvy We are lovely 

Just to be a whore Lovely girls 

Come on, lady Lovely ladies 

What's a lady for What's a lady for 
[PIMP]
Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there

[WHORE #1]
A bit of skirt, she's the one sold her hair

[WHORE #2]
She's got a kid, sends her all that she can

[PIMP]
I might have known, there is always some man
Lovely lady, come along and join us
Lovely lady

[WHORE #1]
Come on dearie, why all the fuss
You're no grander than the rest of us
Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap
Join your sisters—

[WHORE #2]
—Make money in your sleep

[WHORE #1]
That's right, dearie, let him have the lot

[WHORE #3]
That's right, dearie, show him what you've got

[WOMEN]
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come
Harbor rats and alley cats and every type of scum
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land
See them with their trousers off, they're never quite as grand
All it takes is money in your hand

Lovely ladies, going for a song
Got a lot of callers, but they never stay for long

[FANTINE]
Come on, Captain, you can wear your shoes
Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse?
Easy money, lying on a bed
Just as well they never see the hate that's in your head
Don't they know they're making love to one already dead?

[BAMATABOIS]
Here's something new, I think I'll give it a try
Come closer, you. I like to see what I buy
The usual price for just one slice of your pie

[FANTINE]
I don't want you. No, no, Monsieur, let me go

[BAMATABOIS]
Is this a trick? I won't pay more

[FANTINE]
No, not at all

[BAMATABOIS]
You've got some nerve, you little whore
You've got some gall

It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer
The customer sees what he gets in advance
It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir"
Not for the harlot to pick or to choose
Or to lead me a dance

[FANTINE (striking Bamatabois)]
I'll kill you you bastard, try any of that
Even a whore who has gone to the bad
Won't be had by a rat

[BAMATABOIS]
By Christ, you'll pay for what you've done
This rat will make you bleed you'll see
I guarantee, I'll make you suffer
For this disturbance of the peace
For this insult to life and property

[FANTINE]
I beg you, don't report me sir
I'll do what ever you may want

[BAMATABOIS]
Make your excuse to the police

[JAVERT]
Tell me quickly what's the story
Who saw what and why and where
Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert

In this nest of whores and vipers
Let one speak who saw it all
Who laid hands on this good man here
What's the substance of this brawl

[BAMATABOIS]
Javert, would you believe it
I was crossing from the park
When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark

[JAVERT]
She will answer for her actions
When you make a full report
You may rest assured, Monsieur
That she will answer to the court

[FANTINE]
There's a child who sorely needs me
Please Monsieur, she's but that high
Holy God, is there no mercy?
If I go to jail, she'll die

[JAVERT]
I have heard such protestation
Every day for twenty years
Lets have no more explanations
Save your breath and save your tears
Honest work, just reward
That's the way to please the Lord

[VALJEAN]
A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor—

[VALJEAN]
You've done your duty, let her be
She needs a doctor, not a jail

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor!

[FANTINE]
Can this be?

[VALJEAN]
Where will she end
This child without a friend?

I've seen your face before
Show me some way to help you
How have you come to grief
In such a place as this?

[FANTINE]
Monsieur, don't mock me now, I pray
It's hard enough I've lost my pride
You let your foreman send me away
Yes, you were there, and turned aside

[FANTINE]
I never did no wrong

My daughter's close to dying

If there's a God above

He'd let me die instead

[VALJEAN]
Is it true, what I've done

To an innocent soul?

Had I only known then...

[VALJEAN]
In his name, my task has just begun
I will see it done

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor!

[VALJEAN]
I will see it done

[JAVERT]
But Monsieur Mayor!

[VALJEAN]
I will see it done

[VOICE (spoken)]
Look out, it's a runaway cart!

[VARIOUS TOWNSPEOPLE (overlapping)]
Look at that
Look at that
It's Monsieur Fauchelevant
Don't approach
Don't go near
At the risk of your life
He is caught by the wheel
Oh, the pitiful man
Stay away, turn away
There is nothing to do
There is nothing to do

[VALJEAN]
Is there anyone here who will rescue the man
Who will help me to shoulder the weight of the cart?

[VARIOUS TOWNSPEOPLE]
Don't go near him, Mr. Mayor
The load is heavy as hell
The old man's a goner for sure
It'll kill you as well

[Valjean lifts the cart on his own and rescues Fauchelevant.]

[FAUCHELEVANT]
M'sieur le Mayor, I have no words
You come from God, you are a saint

[JAVERT]
Can this be true? I don't believe what I see
A man your age to be as strong as you are
A memory stirs, you make me think of a man...
From years ago, a man who broke his parole
He disappeared...

Forgive me, sir, I would not dare

[VALJEAN]
Say what you must, don't leave it there

[JAVERT]
I have only known one other
Who can do what you have done
He's a convict from the chain gang
He's been ten years on the run

But he couldn't run forever
We have found his hideaway
And he's just been re-arrested
And he comes to court today

Well, of course he now denies it
You'd expect that of a con
But he couldn't run forever
No, not even Jean Valjean

[VALJEAN]
You say this man denies it all
And gives no sign of understanding
Or repentance?
You say this man is going to trial
And that's he's sure to be returned
To serve his sentence?
Come to that, can you be sure
That I am not your man?

[JAVERT]
I have known the thief for ages
Tracked him down through thick and thin
And to make the matter certain
There's the brand upon his skin
He will bend, he will break
This time there is no mistake

[VALJEAN]
He thinks that man is me
He knew him at a glance
That stranger he has found
This man could be my chance

Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?
When I have come so far
And struggled for so long?

If I speak, I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned

I am the master of hundreds of workers
They all look to me
How can I abandon them, how can they live
If I am not free?

If I speak, I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned

Who am I?
Can I condemn this man to slavery
Pretend I do not see his agony
This innocent who bears my face
Who goes to judgement in my place

Who am I?
Can I conceal myself for evermore
Pretend I'm not the man I was before
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi

Must I lie?
How can I ever face my fellow men
How can I ever face myself again
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago

He gave me hope, when hope was gone
He gave me strength to journey on

[Valjean appears in front of the court.]

Who am I? Who am I?
I’m Jean Valjean

[He unbuttons his shirt to reveal the number tattooed to his chest.]

And so Javert, you see it's true
That man bears no more guilt than you
Who am I? 24601!

[FANTINE (lying in a hospital bed, delirious)]
Cosette, it's turned so cold
Cosette, it's past your bedtime
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night

Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading
Don't you see the evening star appearing
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder

Hurry near, another day is dying
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying
There's a darkness which comes without a warning
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning

[VALJEAN (arriving)]
Oh, Fantine, our time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life

[FANTINE]
Look, M'sieur, where all the children play

[VALJEAN]
Be at peace, be at peace evermore

[FANTINE]
My Cosette—

[VALJEAN]
Shall live in my protection

[FANTINE]
Take her now

[VALJEAN]
Your child will want for nothing

[FANTINE]
Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven

[VALJEAN]
And none shall ever harm Cosette
As long as I am living

[FANTINE]
Take my hand
The night grows ever colder

Take my child
I give her to your keeping

[VALJEAN]
Then I will keep you warm

Take shelter from the storm
[FANTINE]
For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her
And I'll see her when I wake

[She dies with a smile. Javert arrives.]

[JAVERT]
Valjean, at last, we see each other plain
"M'sieur le Mayor," you'll wear a different chain

[VALJEAN]
Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me! There is something I must do

This woman leaves behind a suffering child
There is none but me who can intercede
In mercy's name, three days are all I need

Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll return—

[JAVERT]
You must think me mad
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man, such as you

[VALJEAN]
Believe of me
What you will
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do
You know nothing of my life
All I did was steal some bread
[JAVERT]
Men like me can never change
Men like you can never change
No!
24601...

You know nothing of the world
You would sooner see me dead
But not before I see this justice done

My duty's to the law
You have no rights
Come with me, 24601
Now the wheel has turned around
Jean Valjean is nothing now

I am warning you, Javert
I'm a stronger man by far
There is power in me yet
My race is not yet run!
Dare you talk to me of crime
And the price you had to pay
Every man is born in sin
Every man must choose his way

I am warning you, Javert
There is nothing I won't dare
If I have to kill you here
I'll do what must be done!
You know nothing of Javert
I was born inside a jail
I was born with scum like you
I am from the gutter, too
[Valjean breaks a chair and threatens Javert with the broken piece.]

[VALJEAN (turning to Fantine)]
And this I swear to you tonight

[JAVERT]
There is no place for you to hide

[VALJEAN]
Your child will live within my care

[JAVERT]
Wherever you may hide away

[VALJEAN]
And I will raise her to the light

[BOTH]
I swear to you, I will be there

[They fight. Javert is knocked out. Valjean escapes.]

[YOUNG COSETTE (sweeping)]
There is a castle on a cloud
I like to go there in my sleep
Aren't any floors for me to sweep
Not in my castle on a cloud

There is a room that's full of toys
There are a hundred boys and girls
Nobody shouts or talks too loud
Not in my castle on a cloud

There is a lady all in white
Holds me and sings a lullaby
She's nice to see and she's soft to touch
She says, "Cosette, I love you very much"

I know a place where no one's lost
I know a place where no one cries
Crying at all is not allowed
Not in my castle on a cloud

Oh, help! I think I hear them now
And I'm nowhere near finished sweeping
And scrubbing and polishing the floors
Oh, it's her!
It's Madame!

[MADAME THENARDIER (slamming a bucket onto a table)]
Now look who's here, the little madame herself
Pretending once again she's been so awfully good
Better not let me catch you slacking
Better not catch my eye
Ten rotten francs your mother sends me
What is that going to buy?
Now, take that pail, my little "Mademoiselle"
And go and draw some water from the well

We should never had taken you in, in the first place
How stupid the things that we do
Like mother, like daughter, the scum of the street

[Young Éponine appears on stage looking much better groomed than Young Cosette.]

Eponine, come my dear, Eponine, let me see you
You look very well in that little blue hat
There's some little girls who know how to behave
And they know what to wear
And I'm saying thank heaven for that

Still there, Cosette? Your tears will do you no good
I told you fetch some water from the well in the wood

[YOUNG COSETTE]
Please do not send me out alone
Not in the darkness on my own

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Enough of that, or I'll forget to be nice
You heard me ask for something and I never ask twice

[Éponine pushes Cosette out the door. Thénardier appears and bids goodnight to his daughter as the inn fills up for the evening.]

[DRINKERS/DINERS]
Come on you old pest
Fetch a bottle of your best
What's the nectar of the day

[THENARDIER]
Here, try this lot
Guaranteed to hit the spot
Or I'm not Thenardier

[DRINKERS/DINERS]
Gissa glass a' rum
Landlord, over here!

[THENARDIER (to himself, then out loud)]
Right away, you scum
Right away, m'sieur

[DRINKERS/DINERS]
God this place has gone to hell
So you tell me every year

Mine host Thenardier
He was there so they say
At the field of Waterloo
Got there, it's true
When the fight was all through
But he knew just what to do

Crawling through the mud, so I've heard it said
Picking through the pockets of the English dead

He made a tidy score
From the spoils of war

[THENARDIER]
My band of soaks
My den of dissolutes
My dirty jokes
My always pissed-as-newts
My sons of whores
Spend their lives in my inn
Homing pigeons homing in
They fly through my doors
And their money's good as yours

[DRINKERS/DINERS]
Ain't got a clue
What he put in this stew
Must have scraped it off the street

God, what a wine!
Chateau Neuf de Turpentine
Must have pressed it with his feet

Landlord, over here
Where's the bloody man
One more for the road
One more slug o' gin
Just one more
Or my old man is gonna do me in

[THENARDIER (greeting a new customer)]
Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks
Rooking their guests and cooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur

Glad to do a friend a favor, doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing, everything has got a little price!

Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

[DRINKERS/DINERS/THENARDIER]
Master of the house, quick to catch your eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone

[THENARDIER]
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

[Thenardier greets another customer and takes his bag.]

Enter Monsieur, lay down your load
Unlace your boots, rest from the road
This weighs a ton, travel's a curse
But here we strive to lighten your purse
Here the goose is cooked
Here the fat is fried
And nothing's overlooked
Till I'm satisfied

Food beyond compare, food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome, bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges plus some little extras on the side

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut

When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks he knows
How it all increases
All those bits and pieces
Jesus, It's amazing how it grows

[DRINKERS/DINERS/THENARDIER]
Master of the house, quick to catch your eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate
Everybody's boon companion
Gives 'em everything he's got

[THENARDIER]
Dirty bunch of geezers
Jesus, what a sorry little lot

[MADAME THENARDIER]
I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

Master of the house? Isn't worth me spit!
'Comforter, philosopher,' and lifelong shit
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover, but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature
Landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted
Living with this bastard in the house

[DRINKERS/DINERS/THENARDIER]
Master of the house

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Master and a half

[DRINKERS/DINERS/THENARDIER]
Comforter, philosopher

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Don't make me laugh

[DRINKERS/DINERS/THENARDIER]
Servant to the poor, butler to the great

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Hypocrite and toady and inebriate

[DRINKERS/DINERS/THENARDIER]
Everybody bless the landlord
Everybody bless his spouse

[THENARDIER]
Everybody raise a glass

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Raise it up the master's ass

[ALL]
Everybody raise a glass to the master of the house

[Young Cosette reenters with Valjean. They are singing together, improvising a vocalization of Cosette's theme, "Castle On A Cloud."]

[VALJEAN]
I found her wandering in the wood
This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows
And I am here to help Cosette
And I will settle any debt you may think proper
I will pay what I must pay
To take Cosette away

There is a duty I must heed
There is a promise I have made
For I was blind to one in need
I did not see what stood before me

Now her mother is with God
Fantine's suffering is over
And I speak here with her voice
And I stand here in her place

[VALJEAN]
And from this day and evermore

Cosette shall live in my protection

I shall not forsake my vow

Cosette shall have a father now
[MADAME THENARDIER]
Let me have your coat, M'sieur

[THENARDIER]
You are very welcome here

Take a glass

[MADAME THENARDIER]
Take a chair
[THENARDIER (grabbing and 'hugging' Young Cosette)]
What to do, what to say
Shall you carry our treasure away?
What a gem, what a pearl
Beyond rubies is our little girl
How can we speak of debt
Let's not haggle for darling Cosette

Dear Fantine, gone to rest
Have we done for her child what is best
Shared our bread, shared each bone
Treated her like she's one of our own
Like our own, Monsieur

[VALJEAN]
Your feelings do you credit, sir
And I will ease the parting blow
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed
Now, may I say we are agreed?

[MADAME THENARDIER]
That would quite fit the bill
If she hadn't so often been ill
Little dear, cost us dear
Medicines are expensive, M'sieur
Not that we begrudged a sou
It's no more than we Christians must do

[BOTH THENARDIERS]
One thing more, one small doubt
There are treacherous people about
No offense, please reflect
Your intentions may not be correct

[VALJEAN (paying them)]
No more words, here's your price
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice
Come, Cosette, say goodbye
Let us seek out some friendlier sky
Thank you both for Cosette
It won't take you too long to forget

[Mme. Thénardier shoves Little Cosette over to Valjean. Valjean and Little Cosette leave the inn.]

[VALJEAN]
Come, Cosette, come, my dear
From now on I will always be here
Where I go, you will be

[YOUNG COSETTE]
Will there be children and castles to see?

[VALJEAN]
Yes, Cosette, yes, it's true
There's a castle just waiting for you

[Valjean picks Young Cosette up, spinning her in a circle. After setting her down again, they turn and leave for Paris, singing their duet of "Castle On A Cloud" again.]

[BEGGARS]
Look down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man

[GAVROCHE (Beggars continuing in background)]
How do you do? My name's Gavroche
These are my people, here's my patch
Not much to look at, nothing posh
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch
This is my school, my high society
Here in the slums of Saint Michel
We live on crumbs of humble piety
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell
Think you're poor, think you're free
Follow me, follow me!

[BEGGARS]
Look down, and show some mercy if you can
Look down, look down upon your fellow man

[An old beggar woman finds a young prostitute occupying her patch]

[OLD BEGGAR WOMAN]
What you think you're at
Hanging round me pitch
If you're new around here, girl
You've got a lot to learn

[YOUNG PROSTITUTE]
Listen you old bat
Crazy bloody witch
'Least I give my customers
Some pleasure in return

[OLD BEGGAR WOMAN]
I know what you give
Give 'em all the pox
Spread around your poison
Till they end up in a box

[PIMP]
Leave the poor old cow
Move it, Madeleine
She used to be no better
Till the clap got to her brain

[BEGGARS]
When's it gonna end
When we gonna live
Something's gotta happen now or
Something's gonna give
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come

[ENJOLRAS]
Where are the leaders of the land?
Where are the swells who run this show?

[MARIUS]
Only one man and that's LaMarque
Speaks for these people here below

[BEGGARS]
See our children fed
Help us in our shame
Something for a crust of bread
In Holy Jesus' name

[URCHIN]
In the Lord's Holy name

[BEGGARS]
In his name, in his name, in his name

[MARIUS]
LaMarque is ill and fading fast
Won't last the week out so they say

[ENJOLRAS]
With all the anger in the land
How long before the judgement day
Before we cut the fat ones down to size
Before the barricades arise

[GAVROCHE]
Watch out for old Thénardier
All of his family is on the make
Once ran a hash-house down the way
Bit of a swine and no mistake

He's got a gang, the bleeding layabout
Even his daughter does her share
That's Éponine, she knows her way about
Only a kid, but hard to scare
Do we care, not a cuss
Long live us, long live us!

[BEGGARS]
Look down and show
Some mercy if you can
Look down, look down
Upon your fellow man

[THENARDIER (assembling his gang)]
Everyone here, you know your place
Brujon, Babet, Claqusous!
You, Montparnasse, watch for the law
With Eponine, take care
You turn on the tears
No mistakes, my dears

[MADAME THENARDIER]
These bloody students on our streets
Here they come slumming once again
Our Eponine would kiss their feet
She never had a scrap of brain

[MARIUS]
Hey, Eponine, what's up today
I haven't seen you much about

[EPONINE]
Here, you can always catch me in

[MARIUS]
Mind the police don't catch you out

[EPONINE (grabbing his books)]
Here, whatcher doing with all them books
I could have been a student, too
Don't judge a girl on how she looks
I know a lot of things, I do

[MARIUS]
Poor Eponine, the things you know
You wouldn't find in books like these

[EPONINE]
I like the way you grow your hair

[MARIUS]
I like the way you always tease

[EPONINE (to herself)]
Little he knows... little he sees

[Valjean arrives with Cosette, now grown up.]

[MADAME THENARDIER (to Eponine)]
Here's the old boy, stay on the job
And watch out for the law

[EPONINE]
Stay out of this

[MARIUS]
But Eponine—

[EPONINE]
You'll be in trouble here
It's not your concern
You'll be in the clear

[She pushes MARIUS away.]

[MARIUS (seeing Valjean)]
Who is that man?

[EPONINE]
Leave me alone

[MARIUS]
Why is he here?
Hey, Eponine!

[He begins to follow her, and bumps into Cosette.]

I didn't see you there, forgive me

[THENARDIER]
Please M'sieur, come this way
Here's a child that ain't eaten today
Save a life, spare a sou
God rewards all the good that you do
Wait a bit— know that face
Ain't the world a remarkable place
Men like me don't forget
You're the bastard that borrowed Cosette

[Thenardier grabs Valjean and rips open his shirt, revealing the number on his chest.]

[VALJEAN]
What is this? Are you mad?
No, Monsieur, you don't know what you do

[THENARDIER]
You know me, you know me
I'm a con, just like you

[EPONINE]
It's the police!  Disappear!
Run for it!  It's Javert!

[Javert arrives and the fight ceases. Valjean picks himself up and looks for Cosette, who is with Marius.]

[JAVERT]
Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert
M'sieur, the streets are not safe
But let these vermin beware
We'll see that justice is done

Look upon this fine collection
Crawled from underneath a stone
This swarm of worms and maggots
Could have picked you to the bone

I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade
And on your witness, M'sieur
We'll see him suitably paid

[Valjean and Cosette have disappeared.]

But where's the gentleman gone
And why on earth did he run?

[THENARDIER]
You will have a job to catch him
He's the one you should arrest
No more bourgeois when you scratch him
Than that brand upon his chest!

[JAVERT]
Could it be he's some old jailbird
That the tide now washes in?
Heard my name and started running
Had the brand upon his skin

And the girl who stood beside him
When I turned they both had gone
Could he be the man I've hunted?
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?

[THENARDIER]
In the absence of a victim
Dear Inspector, may I go?
And remember when you've nicked him
It was me who told you so!

[JAVERT]
Let the old man keep on running
I will run him off his feet

Everyone about your business
Clear this garbage off the street!

[JAVERT]
There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God, fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
Those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars, in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness with order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be
For so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

Lord let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars
I will never rest
Till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars!

[GAVROCHE]
That inspector thinks he's something
But it's me that runs this town
And my theater never closes
And the curtain's never down
Trust Gavroche, have no fear
Don't you worry, auntie dear
You can always find me here

[EPONINE is alone in the square.]

[EPONINE]
Cosette! Now I remember!
Cosette! How can it be?
We were children together
Look what's become of me

[MARIUS returns.]

Good God! Oh, what a rumpus!

[MARIUS]
That girl, who can she be?

[EPONINE]
That cop! He'd like to jump us
But he ain't smart, not he

[MARIUS]
Éponine, who was that girl?

[EPONINE]
Some bourgeois two-a-penny thing!

[MARIUS]
Éponine, find her for me!

[EPONINE]
What will you give me?

[MARIUS]
Anything!

[EPONINE]
Got you all excited now
But God knows what you see in her
Ain't you all delighted now

[MARIUS offers her money, but she refuses.]

No, I don't want your money sir

[MARIUS]
Éponine, do this for me
Discover where she lives
But careful how you go
Don't let your father know
'Ponine! I'm lost until she's found

[MARIUS leaves.]

[EPONINE]
You see, I told you so!
There's lots of things I know
'Ponine she knows her way around

[COMBEFERRE]
At Notre Dame
The sections are prepared!

[FEUILLY]
At rue de Bac
They're straining at the leash!

[COURFEYRAC]
Students, workers, everyone
There's a river on the run
Like the flowing of the tide
Paris coming to our side!

[ENJOLRAS]
The time is near
So near, it's stirring the blood in their veins
And yet beware
Don't let the wine go to your brains

For the army we fight is a dangerous foe
With the men and the arms that we never can match
Oh, it's easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies
But the national guard will be harder to catch
We need a sign
To rally the people
To call them to arms
To bring them in line!

[MARIUS enters]

Marius, you're late

[JOLY]
What's wrong today?
You look as if you've seen a ghost

[GRANTAIRE]
Some wine and say what's going on

[MARIUS]
A ghost you say, a ghost maybe
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, and she was gone

[GRANTAIRE]
I am agog
I am aghast
Is Marius in love at last
I have never seen him 'ooh' and 'aah'
You talk of battles to be won
But here he comes like Don Ju-an
It's better than an o-per-a!

[ENJOLRAS]
It is time for us all
To decide who we are
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?
Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay
Is it simply a game
For rich young boys to play
The color of the world
Is changing day by day

Red - the blood of angry men
Black - the dark of ages past
Red - a world about to dawn
Black - the night that ends at last

[MARIUS]
Had you been there tonight
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight
Had you been there tonight
You might also have known
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light
And what was right
Seems wrong
And what was wrong
Seems right

[GRANTAIRE]
Red

[MARIUS]
I feel my soul on fire

[GRANTAIRE]
Black

[MARIUS]
My world if she's not there

[ALL]
Red

[MARIUS]
The color of desire

[ALL]
Black

[MARIUS]
The color of despair

[ENJOLRAS]
Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call
Who cares about your lonely soul
We strive toward a larger goal
Our little lives don't count at all

[ALL]
Red - the blood of angry men
Black - the dark of ages past
Red - a world about to dawn
Black - the night that ends at last

[ENJOLRAS]
Well, Courfeyrac, do we have all the guns
Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short
Grantaire, put the bottle down
Do we have the guns we need

[GRANTAIRE]
Give me brandy on my breath
And I’ll breathe them all to death

[COURFEYREC]
In St. Antoine, they’re with us to a man

[COMBEFERRE]
In Notre Dame, they’re tearing up the stones

[FEUILLY]
Twenty rifles, good as new

[GAVROCHE rushes in, shouting.]

[GAVROCHE]
Listen!

[JOLY]
Twenty rounds for every man

[GAVROCHE]
Listen to me

JEAN PROUVAIRE:
Double that in Port St. Cloud

[GAVROCHE]
Listen, everybody

[LESGLES]
Seven guns in St. Martin

[GAVROCHE, spoken]
General LaMarque is dead!

[ENJOLRAS]
LaMarque is dead
LaMarque!
His death is the hour of fate
The people's man
His death is the sign we await

On his funeral day, they will honor his name
It's a rallying cry that will reach every ear
In the death of LaMarque we will kindle the flame
They will see that the day of salvation is near

The time is here
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts
But a jubilant shout
They will come one and all
They will come when we call

[ENJOLRAS]
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

[COMBEFERRE]
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

[COURFEYRAC]
Then join in the fight that will give you
The right to be free!

[ALL]
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

[FEUILLY]
Will you give all you can give
So that our banner may advance?
Some will fall and some will live
Will you stand up and take your chance?
The blood of the martyrs will water
The meadows of France!

[ALL]
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

[COSETTE]
How strange
This feeling that my life's begun at last
This change
Can people really fall in love so fast?
What's the matter with you, Cosette?
Have you been too much on your own?
So many things unclear
So many things unknown

In my life
There are so many questions and answers
That somehow seem wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence
The sigh of a far away song
And it sings
Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach
Just a whisper away
Waiting for me!

Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?
Does he see what I saw?
Does he feel what I feel?

In my life
I'm no longer alone
Now the love in my life is so near
Find me now
Find me here

[VALJEAN]
Dear Cosette
You're such a lonely child
How pensive
How sad you seem to me
Believe me
Were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be
I can see
With only me for company

[COSETTE]
There's so little I know
That I'm longing to know
About the child that I was in a time long ago
There's so little you say
Of the life you have known
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone
So dark, so dark
And deep
The secrets that you keep

In my life
I have all that I want
You are loving and gentle and good
But Papa
Dear Papa
In your eyes I am just like a child
Who is lost in a wood

[VALJEAN]
No more words
No more words
It’s a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard
Better unsaid

[COSETTE]
In my life
I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years
Years ago

[VALJEAN]
You will learn
Truth is given by God to us all
In our time
In our time

[VALJEAN leaves the garden; MARIUS and EPONINE arrive outside]

[MARIUS]
In my life
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life
Seems to stop as if something is over
And something has scarcely begun
Eponine
You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you, I am one with the Gods
And heaven is near!
And I saw through a world that is new
That is free

[EPONINE]
Every word that he says
Is a dagger in me
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere
Where he is
If he asked
I'd be his

[MARIUS and EPONINE]
In my life
There is someone who touches my life

[MARIUS]
Waiting near

[EPONINE]
Waiting here

[MARIUS]
A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Mad'moiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

[COSETTE]
A heart full of love
No fear, no regret

[MARIUS]
My name is Marius Pontmercy

[COSETTE]
And mine's Cosette

[MARIUS]
Cosette, I don't know what to say!

[COSETTE]
Then make no sound!

[MARIUS]
I am lost

[COSETTE]
I am found

[MARIUS]
A heart full of light

[COSETTE]
A night bright as day

[MARIUS]
And you must never go away
Cosette, Cosette!

[COSETTE]
This is a chain we'll never break

[MARIUS]
Do I dream?

[COSETTE]
I'm awake

[MARIUS]
A heart full of love

[EPONINE]
He was never mine to lose

[MARIUS and COSETTE]
A heart full of you

[EPONINE]
Why regret what could not be?

[MARIUS]
A single look and then I knew

[EPONINE]
These are words he'll never say
Not to me
Not to me
Not to me

[COSETTE]
I knew it too

[MARIUS]
From today

[COSETTE]
Every day

[COSETTE & MARIUS] (EPONINE)
And it isn't a dream (His heart full of love)
Not a dream (He will never)
After all! (Feel this way)

[EPONINE]
'Parnasse, what are you doing
So far out of our patch?

[MONTPARNASSE]
This house, we're going to do it
Rich man, plenty of scratch
You remember he's the one
Who got away the other day
Got a number on his chest
Perhaps a fortune put away!

[EPONINE]
Oh Lord, somebody help me!
Dear God, what'll I do?
He'll think this is an ambush
He'll think I'm in it too!

What'll I do, what'll I say?
I've got to warn them here
I've got to find a way

[THENARDIER arrives with the rest of his gang.]

[THENARDIER]
This is his lair
I've seen the old fox around
He keeps himself to himself
He's staying close to the ground
I smell profit here!
Ten years ago
He came and paid for Cosette
I let her go for a song
It's time we settled the debt
This'll cost him dear

[BRUJON]
What do I care
Who you should rob
Give me my share
Finish the job!

[THENARDIER]
You shut your mouth
Give me your hand

[THENARDIER notices EPONINE but doesn't recognize her]

[BRUJON]
What have we here?

[THENARDIER]
Who is this hussy?

[BABET]
It's your brat Eponine
Don't you know your own kid
Why's she hanging about you?

[THENARDIER]
Eponine, get on home
You're not needed in this
We're enough here without you

[EPONINE]
I know this house
I tell you there's nothing here for you
Just the old man and the girl
They live ordinary lives

[THENARDIER]
Don't interfere
You've got some gall
Take care, young miss
You've got a lot to say!

[BRUJON]
She's going soft

[CLAQUESOU]
Happens to all

[MONTPARNASSE]
Go home, 'Ponine
Go home, you're in the way

[EPONINE]
I'm gonna scream
I'm gonna warn them here

[THENARDIER]
One little scream and you'll regret it for a year

[CLAQUESOU]
What a palaver
What an absolute treat
To see a cat and its father
Pick a bone in the street

[BRUJON]
Not a sound out of you!

[EPONINE]
Well, I told you I'd do it
I told you I'd do it

[EPONINE screams]

[THENARDIER]
You wait my girl, you'll rue this night
I'll make you scream, you'll scream all right
Leave her to me, don't wait around
Make for the sewers, go underground

[The gang scatters]

[MARIUS]
It was your cry sent them away
Once more 'Ponine saving the day
Dearest Cosette, my friend 'Ponine
Brought me to you, showed me the way
Someone is near
Let's not be seen
Somebody's here

[MARIUS leaves quickly as VALJEAN enters]

[VALJEAN]
My God, Cosette
I heard a cry in the dark
I heard the shout of angry voices in the street

[COSETTE]
That was my cry you heard, Papa
I was afraid of what they'd do
They ran away when they heard my cry

[VALJEAN]
Cosette, my child
What will become of you

[COSETTE]
Three men I saw beyond the wall
Three men in shadow moving fast

[VALJEAN]
This is a warning to us all
These are the shadows of the past

Must be Javert!
He's found my cover at last!
I've got to get Cosette away
Before they return!

We must get away from shadows
They will never let us be
Tomorrow to Calais
Then a ship across the sea!

Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say no more
Tomorrow we'll away!
Hurry, Cosette, it's time to close another door
And live another day!

[VALJEAN]
One day more
Another day, another destiny
This never ending road to Calvary
These men who seem to know my crime
Will surely come a second time
One day more

[MARIUS]
I did not live until today
How can I live when we are parted

[VALJEAN]
One day more

[MARIUS & COSETTE]
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you, my world has started

[EPONINE]
One more day all on my own

[MARIUS & COSETTE]
Will we ever meet again?

[EPONINE]
One more day with him not caring

[MARIUS & COSETTE]
I was born to be with you

[EPONINE]
What a life I might have known

[MARIUS & COSETTE]
And I swear I will be true!

[EPONINE]
But he never saw me there

[ENJOLRAS]
One more day before the storm
At the barricades of Freedom
When our ranks begin to form
Will you take your place with me?

[MARIUS]
Do I follow where she goes!
Shall I join my brothers there!
Do I stay or do I dare?

[ALL]
The time is now
The place is here

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[JAVERT]
One more day till revolution
We will nip it in the bud
I will join these little schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood!

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[M. & MME. THENARDIER]
Watch them run amuck
Catch'm as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all
Here a little dip
There a little touch
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!

[STUDENTS]
One day to a new beginning
Raise the flag of freedom high!
Every man will be a king
Every man will be a king
There's a new world for the winning
There's a new world to be won
Do you hear the people sing?

[MARIUS]
My place is here
I fight with you!

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[MARIUS & COSETTE]
I did not live until today
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has started

[EPONINE]
One more day all on my own

[JAVERT]
I will join these people's heroes
I will follow where they go
I will know their little secrets
I will know the things they know

[VALJEAN]
One day more!

[M. & MME. THENARDIER]
Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all

[JAVERT]
One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
Tomorrow is the judgement day

[VALJEAN]
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day

[ALL]
Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in Heaven has in store!
One more dawn
One more day
One day more!

[The barricade is now complete.]

[ENJOLRAS]
Here upon these stones, we build our barricade
In the heart of the city we claim as our own
Each man to his duty and don't be afraid
Wait! I will need a report on the strength of the foe

[JAVERT (disguised as a rebel)]
I can find out the truth
I know their ways
Fought their wars
Served my time
In the days
Of my youth!

[PROUVAIRE]
Now the people will fight

[GRANTAIRE]
And so they might
Dogs will back
Fleas will bite

[BOSSUET]
They will do what is right

[MARIUS (spotting Eponine, who is dressed as a boy)]
Hey, little boy, what's this I see?
God, Eponine, the things you do!

[EPONINE]
I know this is no place for me
Still I would rather be with you

[MARIUS]
Get out before the trouble starts
Get out, 'Ponine, you might get shot

[EPONINE]
I got you worried, now I have
That shows you like me quite a lot

[MARIUS]
There is a way that you can help
You are the answer to a prayer
Please take this letter to Cosette
And pray to God that she's still there!

[EPONINE (leaving for the Rue Plumet)]
Little you know...
Little you care!

[Eponine leaves for the Rue Plumet, where she finds Valjean]

[EPONINE]
I have a letter, M'sieur
It's addressed to your daughter Cosette
It's from a boy at the barricade, Sir
In the Rue de Villette

[VALJEAN]
Give me that letter here, my boy

[EPONINE]
He said to give it to Cosette

[VALJEAN (giving her a coin)]
You have my word that my daughter will know
What this letter contains
Tell the young man she will read it tomorrow
And here's for your pains

Go careful now, stay out of sight
There's danger in the streets tonight

[VALJEAN (reading the letter)]
"Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul
And soon you will be gone
Can it be only a day since we met
And the world was reborn?
If I should fall in the battle to come
Let this be my goodbye
Now that I know you love me as well
It is harder to die...
I pray that god will bring me home
To be with you
Pray for your Marius, he prays for you!'"

[Valjean goes in, leaving Eponine alone]

[EPONINE]
And now I'm all alone again nowhere to go
No one to turn to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face so say hello to
And now the night is near
Now I can make believe he's here

Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own, pretending he's beside me
All alone, I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes
And he has found me

In the rain, the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever
And forever

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say, there's a way for us

I love him, but when the night is over
He is gone, the river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers

I love him, but every day I'm learning
All my life, I've only been pretending
Without me, his world would go on turning
A world that's full of happiness
That I have never known

I love him...
I love him...
I love him...
But only on my own

[The barricade is now complete]

[STUDENTS (together)]
Now we pledge ourselves to hold this barricade

[MARIUS]
Let them come in their legions and they will be met!

[ENJOLRAS]
Have faith in yourselves and don't be afraid

[GRANTAIRE]
Let's give 'em a screwing they'll never forget!

[COMBEFERRE]
This is where it begins!

[COURFEYRAC]
And if I should die in the fight to be free
Where the fighting is hardest, there will I be

[FEUILLY]
Let them come if they dare
We'll be there!

[Horns announce the arrival of the army]

[ARMY OFFICER (off-stage, with a loud-hailer)]
You at the barricade listen to this!
No one is coming to help you to fight!
You're on your own
You have no friends
Give up your guns or die!

[ENJOLRAS]
Damn their warnings. Damn their lies!
They will see the people rise!

[STUDENTS (together)]
Damn their warnings. Damn their lies!
They will see the people rise!

[JAVERT (climbs over the barricade)]
Listen my friends, I have done as I said
I have been to their lines
I have counted each man
I will tell what I can

Better be warned, they have armies to spare
And our danger is real
We will need all our cunning
To bring them to heel

[ENJOLRAS]
Have faith! If you know what their movements are
We'll spoil their game
There are ways that a people can fight
We shall overcome their power

[JAVERT]
I have overheard their plans
There will be no attack tonight
They intend to starve us out
Before they start a proper fight
Concentrate their force
Hit us from the right

[GAVROCHE]
Liar!

[GAVROCHE]
Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear
I know this man my friends, his name's Inspector Javert
So don't believe a word he says 'cos none of it's true
This only goes to show what little people can do

And little people know when litle people fight
We may look easy pickings but we've got some bite
So never kick a dog because he's just a pup
We'll fight like twenty armies and we won't give up
So you'd better run for cover when the pup grows up

[GRANTAIRE]
Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class!

[PROUVAIRE]
So what're we gonna do with this snake in the grass?

[ENJOLRAS]
Tie this man and take him to the tavern in there
The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert!

[VARIOUS STUDENTS]
Take the bastard now and shoot him!
Let us watch the devil dance!
You'd have done the same, Inspector
If we'd let you have your chance

[JAVERT]
Shoot me now or shoot me later
Every schoolboy to his sport
Death to each and every traitor
I renounce your people's court

[COMBEFERRE]
Though we may not all survive here
There are things that never die

[GRANTAIRE]
What's the difference, die a schoolboy
Die a policemen, die a spy?

[ENJOLRAS]
Take this man, bring him through
There is work we have to do

[Javert is tied up and taken away]

[JOLY (spoken)]
There's a boy climbing the barricade!

[A shot rings out. Éponine climbs over the barricade.]

[MARIUS]
Good God! What are you doing?
'Ponine, have you no fear?
Have you seen my beloved?
Why have you come back here?

[EPONINE]
Took the letter like you said
I met her father at the door
He said he would give it
I don't think I can stand anymore

[She collapses.]

[MARIUS]
Éponine, what's wrong?
I feel there's something wet upon your hair

[He opens her coat and sees that she has been shot.]

Éponine, you're hurt! You need some help
Oh, God! It's everywhere!

[EPONINE]
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius. I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain, can hardly hurt me now
You're here. That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow

[MARIUS]
But you will live, 'Ponine, dear God above
If I could heal your wounds with words of love

[EPONINE]
Just hold me now, and let it be
Shelter me, comfort me

[MARIUS]
You would live a hundred years, if I could show you how
I won't desert you now...

[EPONINE]
The rain can't hurt me now
This rain will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I’ll sleep in your embrace at last

The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed
The skies begin to clear, and I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far

[MARIUS]
Hush-a-bye, dear Éponine
You won't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt you now
[EPONINE]
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
[MARIUS]
I'm here

[EPOININE]
That's all I need to know

[EPONINE]
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close

And rain...
Will make the flowers...
[MARIUS]
I'll stay with you
'Till you are sleeping

And rain
Will make the flowers
[Marius kisses Éponine and she dies.]

[MARIUS (alone)]
Grow

[Marius pulls Éponine closer, crying as he holds her tightly.]

[ENJOLRAS]
She is the first to fall
The first of us to fall upon this barricade

[MARIUS]
Her name was Eponine
Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid

[COMBEFERRE]
We fight here in her name

[PROUVAIRE]
She will not die in vain

[BOSSUET]
She will not be betrayed

[Éponine's body is carried away. Valjean appears disguised as a soldier.]

[JOLY]
Here comes a man in uniform
What brings you to this place?

[VALJEAN]
I come here as a volunteer

[JOLY]
Approach and show your face

[SENTRY]
You wear an army uniform

[VALJEAN]
That's why they let me through

[JOLY]
You've got some years behind you, sir

[VALJEAN]
There's much that I can do

[JOLY]
You see that prisoner over there?

[GRANTAIRE]
A volunteer like you!

[COMBEFERRE]
A spy who calls himself Javert!

[GRANTAIRE]
He's going to get it, too

[SENTRY]
They're getting ready to attack!

[Enjolras gives Valjean a gun.]

[ENJOLRAS]
Take this and use it well!
But if you shoot us in the back
You'll never live to tell

[VARIOUS STUDENTS]
Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade!
Troops behind them, fifty men or more!

[ENJOLRAS]
FIRE!

[FEUILLY]
Sniper!

[Valjean shoots a sniper that is aiming for Enjolras.]

[BOSSUET]
See how they run away!

[GRANTAIRE]
By God, we've won the day!

[ENJOLRAS]
They will be back again
Make an attack again

[ENJOLRAS (to Valjean)]
For your presence of mind
For the deed you have done
I will thank you, Monsieur
When our battle is won

[VALJEAN]
Give me no thanks, Monsieur
There is something that you can do

[ENJOLRAS]
If it is in my power...

[VALJEAN]
Give me the spy Javert
Let me take care of him

[JAVERT]
The law is inside out
The world is upside down

[ENJOLRAS]
Do what you have to do
The man belongs to you

The enemy may be regrouping
Hold yourselves in readiness
Come on, my friends, back to your positions
The night is falling fast...

[VALJEAN]
We meet again

[JAVERT]
You've hungered for this all your life
Take your revenge
How right you should kill with a knife!

[Valjean cuts Javert's bonds.]

[VALJEAN]
You talk too much
Your life is safe in my hands

[JAVERT]
I don't understand

[VALJEAN]
Get out of here

[JAVERT]
Valjean, take care
I'm warning you...

[VALJEAN]
Clear out of here

[JAVERT]
Once a thief, forever a thief
What you want you always steal!
You would trade your life for mine
Yes,Valjean, you want a deal
Shoot me now for all I care!
If you let me go beware
You'll still answer to Javert!

[VALJEAN]
You are wrong, and always have been wrong
I'm a man, no worse than any man
You are free, and there are no conditions
No bargains or petitions
There's nothing that I blame you for
You've done your duty, nothing more
If I come out of this alive, you'll find me
At number fifty-five Rue Plumet
No doubt our paths will cross again

[Javert leaves. Valjean fires his gun in the air. Muted applause from the students who think Javert has been shot.]

[ENJOLRAS]
Courfeyrac, you take the watch
They won't attack until it's light
Everybody stay awake
We must be ready for the fight
For the final fight
Let no one sleep tonight

(The defenders settle down for the night with wine and a song.)

[ENJOLRAS]
Marius, rest

[FEUILLY]
Drink with me to days gone by
Sing with me the songs we knew

[PROUVAIRE]
Here's to pretty girls who went to our heads

[JOLY]
Here's to witty girls who went to our beds

[ALL]​
Here's to them and here's to you!

[GRANTAIRE]
Drink with me to days gone by
Can it be you fear to die?
Will the world remember you
When you fall?
Could it be your death
Means nothing at all?
Is your life just one more lie?

[MEN]
Drink with me
To days
Gone by
To the life
That used
To be 
[WOMEN]
Drink with me
To days
Gone by
To the life
That used
To be
[WOMEN]
At the shrine of friendship, never say die

[ALL]
Let the wine of friendship never run dry

[MEN]
Here's to you
And here's
To me
[WOMEN]
Here's to you
And here's
To me
[MARIUS]
Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea?
Life without Cosette means nothing at all
Would you weep, Cosette should Marius fall?
Will you weep, Cosette
For me?

[Marius settles down to sleep.]

[VALJEAN (watching over Marius as he rests)]
God on high, hear my prayer
In my need, you have always been there
He is young, he's afraid
Let him rest, heaven blessed

Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

He's like the son I might have known
If God had granted me a son
The summers die, one by one
How soon they fly, on and on
And I am old and will be gone

Bring him peace, bring him joy
He is young, he is only a boy
You can take, you can give
Let him be, let him live
If I die, let me die
Let him live

Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

[Dawn breaks.]

[ENJOLRAS]
The people have not stirred
We are abandoned by those who still live in fear
The people have not heard
Yet we will not abandon those who cannot hear
Let us not waste lives
Let all the women and fathers of children go from here

[FEUILLY]
Drink with me to days gone by
Sing with me the songs we knew

[FEUILLY & ALL]
At the shrine of friendship
Raise your glass high
Let the wine of friendship
Never run dry
If I die, I die with you

[The battle recommences.]

[ENJOLRAS]
Fire!

[ENJOLRAS]
How do we stand, Feuilly?
Make your report

[FEUILLY]
We've guns enough
But ammunition's short

[MARIUS]
Let me go into the streets
There are bodies all around
Ammunition to be had
Lots of bullets to be found!

[ENJOLRAS]
I won't let you go
It's too much of a chance

[MARIUS]
And the same is true
For any man here!

[VALJEAN]
Let me go, he's no more than a boy
I am old, I have nothing to fear

[GAVROCHE]
You need somebody quicker
And I volunteer!

[Gavroche climbs to the other side of the barricade.]

[BOSSUET]
Come back, Gavroche, don't you dare!

[JOLY]
Someone pull him down at once!

[GAVROCHE]
Look at me, I'm almost there!

[A gunshot. It misses.]

[GAVROCHE (collecting ammunition from bodies)]
Little people know, when
Little people fight, we
May look easy pickings
But we've got some bite!

[Another shot. This time, Gavroche is hit.]

[GAVROCHE (pained)]
...So never kick a dog
Because he's just a pup...

[Gavroche is shot again.]

[GAVROCHE (struggling]
....We'll fight like twenty armies
And we won't give up!

[Gavroche throws the ammunition to the students.]

[GAVROCHE (weakly)]
So you'd better run for cover
When the pup grows—

[A final shot. Gavroche dies.]

[ARMY OFFICER (from beyond the barricade)]
You at the barricade listen to this
The people of Paris sleep in their beds
You have no chance, no chance at all
Why throw your lives away?

[ENJOLRAS]
Let us die facing our foes
Make them bleed while we can

[COMBEFERRE]
Make 'em pay through the nose

[COURFEYRAC]
Make 'em pay for every man!

[ENJOLRAS]
Let others rise to take our place
Until the earth
Is free!

[The final battle commences. All the revolutionaries except Marius and Valjean die.]

[THENARDIER (picking through the corpses in the sewers)]
Here's a hint of gold stuck into a tooth
Pardon me, M'sieur
You won't be needing it no more
Shouldn't be too hard to sell

Add it to the pile, add it to the stock
Here among the sewer rats
A breath away from Hell
You get accustomed to the smell

Well someone's got to clean 'em up, my friends
Bodies on the highway, law and order upside down
Someone's got to collect their odds and ends
As a service to the town

[Valjean arrives, carrying Marius. Valjean collapses. Thénardier robs Marius.]

[THENARDIER]
Here's a tasty ring, pretty little thing
Wouldn't want to waste it
That would really be a crime
Thank you, sir, I'm in your debt

Here's another toy, take it off the boy
His heart's no longer going
And he's lived his little time
But his watch is ticking yet!

Well, someone's got to clean them up, my friends
Before the little harvest disappears into the mud
Someone's got to collect their odds and ends
When the gutters run with blood

It's a world where the dog eats the dog
Where they kill for bones in the street
And God in His Heaven, he don't interfere
Cause he's dead as the stiffs at me feet
I raise my eyes to see the heavens
And only the moon looks down
The harvest moon shines down!

[He turns over Valjean's body, recognizes him, and runs off
Valjean comes to, picks up Marius again and walks through the sewers.]

[Valjean, carrying Marius, emerges from the sewers and meets Javert.]

[VALJEAN]
It's you, Javert!
I knew you wouldn't wait too long
The faithful servant at his post once more
This man's done no wrong
And he needs a doctor's care

[JAVERT]
I warned you I would not give in
I won't be swayed

[VALJEAN]
Another hour yet
And then I'm yours
And all our debts are paid

[JAVERT]
The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice

[VALJEAN]
Come, time is running short

Look down, Javert
He's standing in his grave

Give way, Javert
There is a life to save

[JAVERT]
Take him, Valjean
Before I change my mind
[JAVERT]
I will be waiting
24601

[Valjean carries Marius off.]

[JAVERT]
Who is this man, what sort of devil is he?
To have me caught in a trap and choose to let me go free?
It was his hour at last to put a seal on my fate
Wipe out the past and wash me clean off the slate!
All it would take is a flick of his knife
Vengeance was his and he gave me back my life!

Damned if I'll live in the debt of a thief!
Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase
I am the Law and the Law is not mocked
I'll spit his pity right back in his face
There is nothing on earth that we share
It is either Valjean or Javert!

How can I now allow this man
To hold dominion over me
This desperate man whom I have hunted
He gave me my life, he gave me freedom

I should have perished by his hand
It was his right
It was my right to die as well
Instead, I live... but live in hell

And my thoughts fly apart
Can this man be believed?
Shall his sins be forgiven?
Shall his crimes be reprieved?

And must I now begin to doubt
Who never doubted all these years?
My heart is stone and still it trembles
The world I have known is lost in shadow

Is he from heaven or from hell?
And does he know
That granting me my life today
This man has killed me even so?

I am reaching, but I fall
And the stars are black and cold
As I stare into the void
Of a world that cannot hold

I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
There is nowhere I can turn
There is no way to go on!

[He throws himself into the swollen river.]

[WOMAN ONE]
Did you see them going off to fight?

[WOMAN TWO]
Children of the barricade who didn't last the night?

[WOMAN THREE]
Did you see them lying where they died?
Someone used to cradle them and kiss them when they cried

[WOMAN FOUR]
Did you see them lying side by side?

[WOMAN FIVE]
Who will wake them?

[WOMAN SIX]
No one ever will

[TWO]
No one ever told them
That a summer day can kill

[SEVEN]
They were schoolboys
Never held a gun
Fighting for a new world
That would rise up like the sun

[THREE]
Where's that new world now the fighting's done?

[FOUR]
Nothing changes

[SEVEN]
Nothing ever will

[EIGHT]
Every year another brat, another mouth to fill

[SEVEN]
Same old story. What's the use of tears?

[FIVE]
What's the use of praying if there's nobody who hears?

[FIVE into ALL]
Turning, turning, turning, turning, turning
Through the years
 
[GROUP 1] [GROUP 2] 

Turning, turning, turning through the years Turning, turning 

Minutes into hours, and the hours into years Minutes, hours 

Nothing changes, nothing ever can Nothing changes, nothing ever can 

Round about the roundabout and back where you began Round about the roundabout 
[ALL]
Round and round and back where you began!

[Marius sits alone in the ABC cafe.]

[MARIUS]
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone

Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about 'tomorrow'
And tomorrow never came

From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
And I can hear them now!

The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn

[The ghosts of those who died on the barricade appear.]

Oh my friends, my friends forgive me
That I live and you are gone
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on

Phantom faces at the window
Phantom shadows on the floor
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no more

Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me
What your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friend will sing no more

[COSETTE (tending to Marius)]
Every day you walk with stronger step
You walk with longer step
The worst is over

[MARIUS]
Every day, I wonder every day
Who was it brought me here
From the barricade

[COSETTE]
Don't think about it, Marius
With all the years ahead of us
I will never go away
And we will be together every day

Every day
We'll remember that night
And the vow that we made:

A heart full of love
A night full of you
The words are old
But always true
Oh, God, for shame
You did not even know my name

[MARIUS]
Dear Mademoiselle
I was lost in your spell

[Valjean appears, but Marius and Cosette do not see him.]

[COSETTE]
A heart full of love
No fear no regret
"My name is Marius Pontmercy."
[VALJEAN]
She was never mine to keep
She is youthful
She is free
[MARIUS]
Cosette, Cosette!

[COSETTE]
I saw you waiting and I knew.
[VALJEAN]
Love is the garden of the young.

[MARIUS]
Waiting for you
At your feet

[COSETTE]
At your call
[VALJEAN]
Let it be

Let it be.
[They see Valjean.]

[MARIUS & COSETTE]
And it wasn't a dream
Not a dream
After all
[VALJEAN]
A heart full of love
This I give you
On this day


[MARIUS]
Monsieur, this is a day
I can never forget
Is gratitude enough
For giving me Cosette?
Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass
But we will prove our love
To you, whom we shall call
A father to us both
A father to us all

[VALJEAN]
Not another word my son
There's something now that must be done

You've spoken from the heart
And I must do the same
There is a story, sir
Of slavery and shame
That you alone must know

I never told Cosette
She had enough of tears
She's never known the truth
The story you must hear
Of years ago

There lived a man whose named Jean Valjean
He stole some bread to save his sister's son
For nineteen winters, served his time
In sweat, he washed away his crime

Years ago
He broke parole and lived a life apart
How could he tell Cosette and break her heart?
It's for Cosette that this must be faced
If he is caught she is disgraced
The time is come to journey on
And from this day he must be gone
Who am I?
Who am I?

[MARIUS]
You're Jean Valjean

What can I do that will turn you from this?
Monsieur, you cannot leave
Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette
She will never believe!

[VALJEAN]
Make her believe I have gone on a journey
A long way away
Tell her my heart was too full for farewells
It is better this way
Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know

[MARIUS]
I give my word

[VALJEAN]
What I have spoken, why I must go

[MARIUS]
For the sake of Cosette, it must be so

{WEDDING CHORALE}

[Marius and Cosette lead the wedding procession.]

[Chorus (overlapping)]
Ring out the bells upon this day of days
May all the angels of the Lord above
In jubilation, sing their songs of praise
(In jubilation, sing their songs of praise)
And crown this blessed time
(And crown this blessed time)
With peace and love
(Peace and love)

[The procession becomes a dancing celebration. A waltz is played.]

[MAJOR DOMO]
The Baron and Baroness de Thenard wish to pay their respects to the groom!

[THENARDIER]
I forget where we met
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge
Where the Duke did that puke
Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage?

[MARIUS]
No, 'Baron de Thenard'
The circles I move in are humbler by far
Go away, Thenardier!
Do you think I don't know who you are?

[MME. THENARDIER]
He's not fooled. Told you so
Show M'sieur what you've come here to show
Tell the boy what you know!

[Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes.]

[MARIUS]
When I look at you, I remember Eponine
She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth
But now she is with God and happier, I hope
Than here on earth!

[The waltz starts up again.]

[THENARDIER]
So it goes, heaven knows
Life has dealt me some terrible blows

[MME. THENARDIER]
You've got cash and a heart
You could give us a bit of a start
We can prove, plain as ink
Your bride's father is not what you think

[THENARDIER]
There's a tale I could tell

[MME. THENARDIER]
Information we're willing to sell

[THENARDIER]
There's a man what he slew
I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you!
What I tell you is true!

[MME. THENARDIER]
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this
But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss

[MARIUS]
In God's name say what you have to say

[THENARDIER]
But first you pay!

What I saw, clear as light
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night
Had this corpse on his back
Hanging there like a bloody great sack
I was there, never fear
Even found me this fine souvenir

[Thenardier shows Marius a ring.]

[MARIUS]
I know this. This was mine
This is surely some heavenly sign!

[THENARDIER]
One thing more, mark this well
It was the night the barricades fell

[MARIUS]
Then it's true. Then I'm right
Jean Valjean was my savior that night!

As for you, take this too!

[Marius punches Thenardier and then throws money at him.]

God forgive us the things that we do
Come my love, come Cosette
This day's blessings are not over yet

[Marius and Cosette exit.]

{BEGGARS AT THE FEAST}

[THENARDIER]
Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat?
Hob-nobbin' here among the elite?
Here comes a prince, there goes a Jew
This one's a queer, but what can you do?

Paris at my feet, Paris in the dust
And here's me breaking bread
With the upper crust!

Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance!
Life is easy pickings, if you grab your chance
Everywhere you go, law-abiding folk
Doing what is decent, but they're mostly broke!

Singing to the Lord on Sundays
Praying for the gifts He'll send

[M. & MME. THENARDIER:]
But we're the ones who take it
We're the ones who make it in the end!

Watch the buggers dance, watch 'em till they drop
Keep your wits about you and you stand on top!
Masters of the land, always get our share
Clear away the barricades, and we're still there!

We know where the wind is blowing
Money is the stuff we smell
And when we're rich as Croesus
Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell!

[VALJEAN (with only a bare wooden cross for company)]
Alone, I wait in the shadows
I count the hours till I can sleep
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by
It made her weep to know I die

Alone at the end of the day
Upon this wedding night, I pray
Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace
And show them grace

God on high, hear my prayer
Take me now to thy care
Where You are, let me be
Take me now, take me there

Bring me home
Bring me home

[Fantine's spirit appears to Valjean.]

[FANTINE]
Monsieur, I bless your name
Monsieur, lay down your burden
You raised my child in love
[VALJEAN]
I am ready, Fantine
At the end of my days
She's the best of my life
[FANTINE]
And you will be with God

[Marius and Cosette rush into the room. They do not see Fantine.]

[COSETTE]
Papa, Papa, I do not understand!
Are you alright? They said you'd gone away

[VALJEAN]
Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now?
Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day

[MARIUS]
It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It's you who must forgive a thankless man
It's thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet

Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home to you!

[VALJEAN]
Now you are here
Again, beside me
Now, I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

[Cosette]
You will live!
Papa, you're going to live!
It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye

[Valjean]
Yes, Cosette
Forbid me now to die
I'll obey... I will try...

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of those who always loved you:

Your mother gave her life for you
And gave you to my keeping

[Valjean dies.]

[FANTINE (beckoning)]
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last, behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy

[VALJEAN]
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to Your glory

[Marius comforts Cosette while Valjean joins Fantine and Eponine.]

[FANTINE & EPONINE]
Take my hand
And lead me to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

[VALJEAN, FANTINE, & EPONINE]
And remember
The truth that once was spoken:

To love another person is to see the face of God!

[The spirits of Enjolras, Gavroche, and the revolutionaries are heard and appear.]

[ENSEMBLE (softly, gaining strength)]
Do you hear the people sing?
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the Earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
They will walk behind the ploughshare
They will put away the sword

The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward

Who will join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Somewhere beyond the barricade

When tomorrow comes!

Aah, aah, aah
Tomorrow comes!
